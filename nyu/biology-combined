   Molecular mechanisms underlying early development in Drosophila

   Transcriptional activation of the early Drosophila genome

   Untitled1.png The broad goal of my research program is to understand
   the molecular mechanisms that control early embryonic development. We
   use genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches to study gene
   regulatory networks in the early Drosophila embryo. Initially the
   embryo relies on maternally deposited gene products to begin
   developing, and the transition to reliance on its own zygotic-gene
   activity is called the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT
   represents a major cellular reprogramming event whereby thousands of
   maternal RNAs are degraded and hundreds of new zygotic RNAs are
   transcribed during the time between egg fertilization and blastoderm
   formation. Recently we discovered a key transcriptional regulator
   called Zelda, which plays a key role in this reprogramming event. Our
   goal is to understand how Zelda mediates the rapid and robust
   activation of the zygotic genome and how it works together with the
   other key transcription factors to prepare the embryo for major
   developmental processes such as gastrulation and tissue
   differentiation.

   Currently, the major project in the lab aims to understand how Zelda
   functions at the mechanistic level. Zelda is a zinc-finger
   transcription factor, and binds to CAGGTAG and related sites (Liang et
   al., 2008). Interestingly, our genome-wide binding analysis
   (ChIP-chip/seq) showed that Zelda binds to known enhancers in the early
   embryo to such an extent that Zelda binding is a predictive indicator
   of the location of an enhancer (Nien et al., 2012). Zelda is the major
   Zelda binds enhancers well before the gene is activated (Harrision et
   pioneer factor, a special class of transcription factors that bind
   target sites in chromatin, allowing other factors access to enhancers
   (reviewed in Zaret and Carroll, 2011). In this way, Zelda may
   potentiate the activity of other transcription factors such as the
   patterning morphogens, an exciting hypothesis that points to the
   significance of Zelda function in embryonic patterning. We believe that
   Zelda works together with morphogens, and though we do not yet know how
   they interact, one fact is clear - that without Zelda, morphogens
   cannot function to their full potential, particularly when at low
   concentrations, and target genes are not activated at the right time
   and in the right place. Mechanistically, Zelda may act as a beacon on
   chromatin for other transcription factors. Without Zelda, these factors
   may not position correctly, and redistribute to other regions of the
   genome. In collaboration with the Zeitlinger lab at Stowers Institute,
   we are examining the chromatin landscape in wild type and zelda mutant
   embryos to determine how Zelda cooperates with other key regulators
   during the MZT.

   A second Zelda project stems from the observation that Zelda is
   expressed in older embryos and larva, specifically in imaginal discs
   and the brain. For example in the eye disc and optic lobe of the brain,
   Zelda is expressed in the undifferentiated cells and is down-regulated
   upon differentiation. In the opitc lobe neuroepithelium, which
   comprises stem cells that give rise to neuroblasts/neurons, loss of
   Zelda causes premature differentiation. We propose that Zelda
   establishes the neural stem cell gene network, which prepares cells for
   the neuropeithelial to neuroblast transition.

   The projects in the my lab require the use of several types of
   approaches from manipulating genes and transgenes and observing the
   output phenotypes, to systems/genome-wide studies that require
   bioinformatic analysis. We also collaborate with systems biologist Stas
   Shvartsman, who models Zelda interactions with the patterning
   morphogens. Together these approaches will allow an understanding of
   how global factors like Zelda interact with key regulators to control
   robust expression of the early zygotic genome.

   I teach the undergraduate Genetics course. I participate in team-taught
   graduate lecture courses: Biocore I and II (the graduate core classes),
   and Developmental Genetics. I also run a graduate seminar, Current
   Topics in Genetics. In addition, I mentor several undergraduate
   students for their independent studies in the lab and their honors
   theses, as well as several Master's students for their Lab in Molecular
   Biology courses and Master's theses.

   I received my Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut in 1983. My
   thesis mentor was Dr. Arthur Chovnick, a well known geneticist who
   studied gene organization in Drosophila. I moved to the laboratory of
   Dr. David Ish-Horowicz at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London,
   England to study developmental biology. I was particularly interested
   in the problem of cell fate determination. In 1986, I moved to Dr.
   Michael Levine's laboratory at Columbia University to study the problem
   of how morphogen gradients control cell fate. We discovered that the
   dorsal morphogen gradient is created by the mechanism of regulated
   nuclear transport.

   In 1991 I started my own lab at the Roche Institute of Molecular
   Biology in New Jersey where I showed how the dorsal morphogen acts as a
   transcriptional repressor to control target gene expression. In 1995 I
   joined the faculty of New York University as an associate professor and
   was tenured in 1999. We have been studying how Dpp functions as a
   morphogen and how it differs from the classical morphogens Dorsal and
   Bicoid. We showed that feed forward motifs predominate in how Dpp
   regulates downstream target genes rather than the differential binding
   affinity mechanism.

   My research revolves around proteins, their properties, evolution, and
   expression patterns. I am a systems biologist who uses statistical and
   computational tools, large-scale quantitative mass spectrometry, and
   molecular biology techniques to study the dynamics of the cellular
   proteome.

   Quantitative shotgun proteomics

   fig1.png Until recently, it was impossible to accurately estimate the
   absolute and relative concentrations of thousands of proteins in
   complex biological samples. Our quantitative proteomics technology
   called APEX (Absolute Protein Expression Index, Nature Biotech, 2007
   25(1)) allows us to do so ‚ for everything from bacteria to yeast and
   human. Mass spectrometry data is highly complex, and we continuously
   improve our data mining methods with respect to the identification and
   quantification of proteins. For example, in MSpresso and MSnet
   (Bioinformatics 2009a, b), we use mRNA expression data and protein
   functional network information, respectively, to increase the number of
   proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry analysis.

   The dynamics of protein expression

   The expression levels of proteins are determined by transcription,
   translation, mRNA and protein stability, and these processes are
   regulated by a plethora of mechanisms. Thus, the relationship between
   protein and mRNA expression levels varies across organisms and sets of
   proteins (Mol BioSystems, 2009 5(12)). Using yeast and human cell
   lines, we characterize the proteome and transcriptome under normal
   conditions and in response to stimuli. Time course data allows us to
   describe cellular processes as dynamical systems and will enable us to
   better understand protein expression regulation ‚ both mathematically
   and biologically.

   Proteomics characterization of translation regulators

   The human genome encodes ~600 proteins with RNA-binding domains, and
   many of these proteins are putative translation regulators. Using
   quantitative proteomics approaches and complementary molecular biology
   techniques, we characterize the impact of RNA-binding proteins on the
   'translation regulatory network'. One example is Musashi-1 which is a
   key regulator involved in brain tumor formation, and we analyze its
   impact on the human proteome and transcriptome. This project is carried
   out in collaboration with Luiz Penalva (UTexas San Antonio).

   Genetic and Mechanistic approaches to development. From the early
   embryo to the Drosophila visual system.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   Research

   Our laboratory focuses on two major developmental questions: The
   evolution of early embryonic development and the establishment of
   retinal and brain circuitry that underlies color vision. These distinct
   systems represent paradigms for understanding how pattern formation is
   genetically controlled.

   * The first project is an Evo-Devo approach to the earliest steps of
   insect development, the formation of the antero-posterior embryonic
   axis. In flies, the morphogenetic gradient of the Bicoid protein is
   essential for anterior development. However, bicoid is not conserved
   and is a newly evolved gene that has taken over the ancestral function.
   We are using the wasp Nasonia as an alternate model system to study how
   a very distant species patterns its axis. Nasonia is a Hymenoptera that
   diverged from Diptera over [fig_1.jpg] 200MY ago but exhibits a long
   germband mode of development similar to flies. The genome of Nasonia is
   sequenced and there are early developmental mutants and parental RNAi
   to address gene function. We have shown that Nasonia, like flies,
   utilizes an anterior morphogenetic center to generate the patterning
   information required for the formation of all segments but uses
   localized otd instead of bcd mRNA. Our ongoing investigations attempt
   to understand the entire segmentation pattern in Nasonia, with the goal
   of reaching the same level of mechanistic detail as in Drosophila.

   * The other system that we study is the determination of the retinal
   mosaic that underlies color vision in flies. Color vision is achieved
   through the comparison in the brain of inputs coming from
   photoreceptors containing rhodopsins with different wavelength
   specificity. Different rhodopsins are expressed in stochastic but
   mutually [fig_2.jpg] exclusive patterns in the compound eye of
   Drosophila as in cones of the vertebrate retina. A given rhodopsin gene
   is stochastically chosen, leading to repression of all others. Another
   mechanism must then inform the brain of its connection to a
   photoreceptor with a given color sensitivity. We have used molecular
   and genetic approaches to decipher the genetic network that controls
   the specification of the 8 types of photoreceptors that form the
   retinal mosaic.

   * Visual information is processed in the optic lobes. Two types of
   photoreceptors mediate motion detection or color discrimination by
   projecting to lamina (motion) or medulla (color) parts of the optic
   lobes. We focus our attention on the medulla that contains a finite
   number of neurons and serves as a paradigm to understand the
   development and function of a sophisticated neural structure. We have
   defined 70 medulla cell types: projection neurons, local interneurons,
   columnar neurons (that contact photoreceptors from each unit eye), and
   non-columnar neurons (that contact termini from several unit eyes).
   These neurons form overlapping retinotopic maps before projecting to
   the lobula complex or back to the lamina. We study how medulla neuron
   diversity is generated and how these neurons establish their
   retinotopic connections to photoreceptors. Neuronal specification
   appears to result from the integration of three mechanisms: (i)
   Neuroblasts sequentially acquire distinct identity and produce unique
   diversifies their daughter cells (iii) regionalization of the medulla
   modifies the neuroblast program for further neuronal diversity. We use
   this knowledge together with electrophysiology and behavior assays to
   investigate how neuronal types function in the motion and chromatic
   pathways.

   My research in computational biology and neuroscience integrates data
   from experimental studies, theoretical analysis, mathematical modeling,
   and computer simulation.

   One of my ongoing projects, in vertebrate phototransduction, focuses on
   light adaptation in rods and cones, and on the reproducibility of rod
   responses to single photons.  Electrophysiological and biochemical data
   provide a basis for developing mathematical models that account for
   light adaptation and statistical properties of the singe-photon
   response in terms of the molecular mechanisms underlying
   phototransduction.

   Another ongoing project involves the development of "statistical
   mechanical" methods for modeling large neural networks.  These methods
   employ the theory of the probability (population) density function.
   Factors that make conventional methods unwieldy or intractable -
   thousands of neurons and millions of synapses ¬¨are used to great
   advantage in these methods. Similar neurons are lumped together into
   populations, and one tracks the distribution of neurons over state
   space in each population.  The state of a neuron is determined by the
   dynamic variables in the underlying single-neuron model.  The
   population-firing rate is given by the flux of probability across a
   particular surface in state space. Neurons are coupled via stochastic
   neuron is determined by the rate of action potentials in each of the
   presynaptic populations and by the average number of synapses the
   postsynaptic neuron receives from each of these populations.

   In an ongoing collaboration with Arjun Raj at the University of
   Pennsylvania, I am analyzing and modeling stochastic gene expression.
   The models include gene switching, synthesis and degradation of mRNA
   and proteins, and cell divisions. A goal is to understand sources of
   large fluctuations in the number of transcripts from genes that are
   expressed at low levels, the consequences for protein levels, and the
   implications for cell fate and cell physiology in general. Future
   modeling will focus on gene networks.

   Finally, I am collaborating with Professor Gloria Coruzzi and her lab
   on projects involving the identification and modeling of gene
   regulatory networks underlying nitrogen assimilation and metabolism in
   Arabidopsis. Statistical analysis of microarray, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq
   data plays a central role in these projects.

   Evolution of development, molecular systematics, and developmental
   genetics of the male tail in nematodes related to C. elegans.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   Using the developmental genetic model system Caenorhabditis elegans, we
   are characterizing genes responsible for morphogenesis, a collection of
   fundamental developmental mechanisms that shape and organize cells into
   particular forms. C. elegans is used for this study because it is
   complex enough to share components and mechanisms of more complex
   multicellular animals, but is simple enough to be described in complete
   terms. The structure we are using as a model for morphogenesis is the
   sexually dimorphic tail tip. This simple feature is constructed of only
   4 cells that, in males only, fuse very late in juvenile ("larval")
   development and change their cellular structure and position. This
   results in a blunt shape (the pointy shape of the hermaphrodite tail
   results from lack of morphogenetic change). We've finished a complete
   transmission electron microscopic reconstruction of these cellular
   events using serial sections, providing a descriptive foundation for
   further functional studies. We have isolated several mutations that
   fail at certain steps of male tail tip morphogenesis, and are currently
   cloning the genes defined by these mutations to understand their
   molecular functions.

   [TailTipCellsS.gif]
   Figure: Model of the 4tail tip cells in a C. elegans larva (cuticle
   removed). Click for a larger image.

   Evolutionary changes in the development of the tail tip have also
   occurred. Using molecular phylogenetic analysis in combination with a
   developmental genetic approach, we are reconstructing the developmental
   changes that have occurred in male tails during the evolution of family
   Rhabditidae (of which C. elegans is a member). So far we have found
   several mutations that closely mimic evolutionary changes, suggesting
   candidate genes that could have been involved in evolutionary changes.
   These investigations will provide specific information about the genes
   and processes conserved in morphogenetic mechanisms as well as insight
   into the ways that these mechanisms can change to produce variation in
   multicellular form.

   The interaction of mammalian RNA polymerases with damaged sites in
   expressed genes

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   The research in my laboratory primarily involves the study of
   interactions of chemical and physical agents with DNA, and the
   processing of the resulting damage by cells. To that end, we have been
   examining the removal of chemical adducts from discrete regions of the
   genome. This is being done in an effort to characterize a phenomenon
   known as DNA repair heterogeneity that is typified by the preferential
   removal of DNA damage from active genetic loci. The implications of
   biases in DNA repair are vast: Certain segments of the chromosome might
   be more susceptible to mutagenesis than other domains, making them hot
   spots for the induction of a variety of detrimental biological outcomes
   including tumorigenesis and cell death.

   A second area of ongoing research involves investigating the effect of
   site-specific DNA damage on transcription by a variety of RNA
   polymerases. We use oligonucleotides containing polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, an important class of chemical carcinogens, for these
   studies. We have shown that some of these adducts impede transcription
   stereochemical configuration of the DNA lesion.

   As a consequence of the antiparallel arrangement of the two strands of
   the DNA double helix and the 5'-3' polarity of DNA polymerases, DNA
   replication is intrinsically asymmetric. Only one parental strand at
   the replication fork can be continuously replicated: the other -- the
   lagging strand -- is discontinuously synthesized via the iterative
   generation, processing and ligation of Okazaki fragments to generate an
   intact daughter strand.

   Figure 1

   Lagging-strand synthesis requires a coordinated sequence of several
   enzymatic activities (Fig. 1). Each Okazaki fragment is (i) initiated
   by Pola/primase and (ii) subsequently extended by DNA polymerase d
   finally, (iv) DNA ligase joins the fragment to the nascent daughter
   strand. My lab is interested in several broad questions related to the
   regulation and coordination of lagging-strand synthesis, which we
   investigate using a combined genetic, biochemical and genomic approach
   in the model yeast S. cerevisiae.

   I graduated from Cambridge University in 2004 with a B.A. in Natural
   Sciences, and immediately moved to New York to pursue a Ph.D. at The
   Rockefeller University. At Rockefeller I worked with Magda Konarska,
   investigating the determinants of substrate specificity during pre-mRNA
   splicing while maintaining a side-interest in the intrinsic catalytic
   potential of RNA. In 2009 I moved across York Avenue to join Iestyn
   Iestyn, I developed genomics techniques to study lagging-strand
   synthesis in vivo in budding yeast. I started my lab at NYU in
   September 2013.

   Classical studies of molecular biology revealed how cells sense their
   environment and respond to change, establishing the centrality of gene
   regulation in cellular physiology. Numerous mechanisms in bacteria,
   however, function in a largely deregulated way, generating a diversity
   of responses across the population, without necessarily sensing the
   environment. The existence of such stochastic mechanisms raises several
   (increasingly difficult) questions: (1) How do microorganisms employ
   stochasticity to their advantage? (2) Can we distinguish such adaptive
   stochasticity from useless noise that is simply too costly for cells to
   avoid? (3) How, and under what circumstances, do sensing mechanisms
   evolve? My research employs theoretical and computational modeling of
   bacteria populations in fluctuating environments, and comparative
   genomics of experimentally-characterized stochastic switches.

   Closely related topics of research include the evolution of mutation
   rates, mutator phenotypes, and mutational hotspots in genomes. My other
   interests include protein folding and protein evolution.

   I received my Ph.D in Biophysics from Harvard University, where I
   worked with Eugene Shakhnovich on physical aspects of protein folding,
   including relaxation dynamics and packing of protein sidechains,
   high-resolution Monte Carlo simulation of folding, and theory related
   to protein evolution. I went on to do post-doctoral work with Stanislas
   Leibler at The Rockefeller University where, starting with simple
   models of antibiotic persistence in E. coli, we worked towards
   understanding in some generality the evolutionary advantage of
   stochastic phenotype switches in microorganisms. We eventually found
   that these mechanisms are intimately connected with information
   acquisition in a general sense, and that in certain cases the
   evolutionary advantage of phenotype switching can be expressed in
   purely information theoretic terms. I joined the NYU faculty in the
   Department of Biology in September 2006, where I am working on theory
   and modeling of evolution in microorganisms.

   Neuroplasticity of the brain regulated by neuronal serotonin and glial
   S-100 protein

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   The morphology of brain cells in the adult brain is in constant flux
   due to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. In experimental animals, the
   mature phenotype of neurons can be lost in the adult brain when trophic
   factors are withdrawn, and reestablished upon replacement. We have been
   studying reversible brain changes for over 20 years and recently
   proposed a model based on neuronal instability to explain these
   changes. The shape of a cell, whether neuronal or glial, is dependent
   on the integrity of the cytoskeleton composed mainly of microtubules
   and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs). MAPs function to sta-bilize
   the tubulin polymers. When the MAPs are phosphorylated, they can no
   longer attach to the polymers, and the long strands of tubulin
   depolymerize. This results in a collapse of the cellular morphology,
   e.g. dendritic and process retraction. S100b is a soluble glial protein
   concentrated in neurons, which protects MAPs from phos-phorylation. We
   have shown that the addition of S100b stabilizes and promotes the
   extension of dendritic processes.Serotonin, acting on the 5-HT1A high
   affinity receptor, can stimulate the release of S100b from astrocytes.
   recpt_small.jpg Glucocorticoids, secreted during stress, can enhance
   serotonin turnover and adrenalectomy has the opposite effect of
   reducing serotonin activity. Both adrenalectomy (removing source of
   glucocorticoids) or depletion of serotonin (by injecting the
   substituted amphetamines or specific synthesis inhibitors) have been
   found to reduce dendritic staining and synapse number in hippocampus
   and cortex. This reduction of mature neuronal morphology is rapidly
   reversible upon replacement of steroids or serotonin. Others have found
   similar examples of retraction and expansion manipulating estrogen,
   dopamine, norepinephrine and NGF. We propose a model of neuronal
   instability to explain these reversible changes in neuronal shape and
   connections. Our results obtained in experimental animals may have
   applicability to brain volumetric and neurophilic changes seen in
   alcoholism, anorexia nervosa, Alzheimer's and depression. As is evident
   in the hibernating ground squirrel or cycling female rat, loss of
   dendrites may represent a normal response of a cell to a changing
   trophic environment, which could represent healthy plasticity rather
   than irreversible pathology.

   Stem cell biology, cell fate differentiation, developmental
   neuroscience

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   RESEARCH

   Embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation has the potential to be
   instrumental in cell based therapies and in vitro disease modeling and
   chemical screens. To fulfill those expectations, ESCs have to be
   directed at high efficiency to disease relevant cell types, either by
   the application of extracellular signals or direct programming by
   forced expression of transcription factors. Therefore, our long term
   goal is to understand how extracellular signals and transcription
   factors control cell fate and apply that knowledge to differentiate ESC
   into disease relevant neuronal cell types.

   Mechanisms of direct neuronal programming Recent advances in cell
   programming demonstrated that terminal cell fate can be established by
   a handful of selector transcription factors. To understand cell
   differentiation and to gain control of cell fate during direct
   programming, it is necessary to rationalize how selector factors
   recognize their genomic targets and control gene expression. The
   plastic genetic state of ESC is particularly receptive to the
   programming activity of transcription factors. Therefore, the
   expression of few factors programs ESC into neurons at high efficiency
   allowing us to apply biochemical interrogation techniques to study gene
   expression, physiological properties, chromatin status and genomic
   occupancy of transcription factors. Preliminary data suggests that
   programming transcription factors synergize to activate cell-specific
   transcriptional programs. Thus, instead of ‚selector genes,‚ ‚selector
   cassettes‚ are the functional units controlling cell fate. We hope to
   derive rules that allow the rational design of programming selector
   cassettes.

   Hox gene function during motor neuron differentiation The central
   nervous system is composed by a myriad of neuronal types and subtypes
   that are essential for proper connectivity and function. However, the
   subtype identity is rarely controlled during ESC directed
   differentiation or cellular programming. Therefore, successful in vitro
   differentiation protocols to be applied either for cell based therapies
   or disease modeling should produce neurons with defined generic and
   subtype identity. During in vivo and in vitro differentiation, members
   of the Hox family of transcription factors impose subtype identity and
   control motor neuron (MN) connectivity. Thus, understanding how Hox
   genes interact and synergize with MN resident factors to control
   subtype identity is the key to manipulating MN identity. Based on
   phenotypic characterization, expression analysis and ChIP-seq of Hox
   genes during in vitro MN differentiation, we plan to identify the
   enhancer structure at Hox binding sites and to establish the minimal
   set of cofactors and molecular logic required for Hox gene activity in
   MNs. The final measure of our understanding of Hox gene activity will
   be the direct generation of precise MN subtypes at will.

   Generation of cells relevant for human neurodegenerative diseases In
   vitro differentiation of human ESC has the potential to serve as a
   ‚humanized‚ platform to study complex neurodegenerative diseases.
   Current protocols based on human stem cells are inefficient and/or take
   several weeks and are thus inappropriate for large-scale phenotypic
   characterization and drug screens. We take advantage of sets of
   transcription factors that program mouse ESC to two types of human
   neurons with different sensitivities to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
   (ALS). These cells would become an in vitro human model to investigate
   intrinsic resistance to ALS. Comparing the transcriptomic and
   epigenomic landscapes of these two cell types under normal and stressed
   conditions might yield insight into new approaches to treat
   neurodegenerative diseases. In the future, both cell types can be the
   substrate for chemical screens to identify molecules that enhance MN
   survival.

   Genomics, genetics and evolution of early C. elegans development.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   We study the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms underlying early
   embryonic development using a combination of molecular genetic and
   functional genomics approaches in the animal model C. elegans and
   related nematodes. One of our major goals is to use RNA interference
   (RNAi) of ovary-expressed genes followed by time-lapse microscopy to
   work toward a comprehensive molecular description of early
   embryogenesis in C. elegans. RNAi offers a powerful way to obtain
   information about the loss-of-function phenotype of the genes tested,
   while the early embryo offers a system in which basic cellular and
   developmental processes can be easily studied. We currently have tested
   over 1,000 genes and identified about 300 genes required for
   embryogenesis. Although most of these genes are highly conserved, fewer
   than 10% have been identified in previous genetic screens. We use the
   data obtained from the RNAi tests to build gene clusters based on
   phenotypic analysis. The clusters are then used to guide two broad
   lines of investigation: (1) functional analysis of the genome, and (2)
   molecular dissection of specific cellular processes.

   From the initial clustering studies, we have found groups of genes
   required for basic processes such as nuclear movements, mitotic spindle
   formation, cytokinesis, cell cycle progression, and proper asymmetric
   cell division. In many cases, these clusters contain genes that are
   conserved in humans. However, their function in humans is not yet
   known. Therefore, our data can be used not only to analyze the C.
   elegans genome but also to guide the functional examination of the
   human genome. In our current dataset we have already found genes for
   which the human homolog is associated with a genetic disease, including
   some that have been previously targeted for anti-cancer drug
   development.

   In a related project we are using the early nematode embryo as a model
   to study the evolution of developmental mechanisms. Comparisons across
   species have revealed fundamental differences during early
   embryogenesis. Significantly, in some species the wild-type patterns of
   early cleavages resemble those produced by various C. elegans mutants.
   We are examining these phenotypic differences in conjunction with
   molecular analyses to identify mechanisms underlying the phenotypic
   diversity seen in nature.

   epigenetics, epigenomics, chromatin

   Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in phenotype that occur
   without changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential
   for many cellular processes, such as gene-expression regulation, genome
   organization and cell-fate determination. Defects in epigenetic
   regulation have been implicated in a variety of diseases, including
   cancer. The aim of our research is to understand the fundamental
   principles of epigenetic regulation. Toward this goal, we have chosen
   to study the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), a model
   eukaryotic organism well suited to a combination of powerful
   experimental approaches, including genetics, cell biology, biochemistry
   and genomics. Importantly, fission yeast contains many conserved
   epigenetic components, and has thus emerged as a premier model for
   epigenetic study.

   Epigenetic Regulation of Heterochromatin
   In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged together with histone proteins into an
   ordered, highly complex chromatin structure. Chromatin exists in two
   forms: euchromatin and heterochromatin. Euchromatin is typically
   transcriptionally active and loosely packaged, whereas heterochromatin
   is gene-poor and appears highly compact throughout the cell cycle.
   Heterochromatin is a classic example of epigenetic phenomena and plays
   an important role in gene regulation, chromosome segregation and genome
   stability. Taking advantage of powerful genetic and biochemical
   approaches available in fission yeast, we have identified multiple key
   heterochromatin factors. We aim to understand the epigenetic mechanisms
   that regulate establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin.

   Epigenetic Regulation of Centromeres
   Centromeres are specific chromosomal loci where the kinetochore, a
   multiprotein complex, is assembled. Kinetochores mediate attachment of
   spindle microtubules to centromeres, ensuring proper segregation of
   chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. A fundamental question in
   biology is how centromere identity is defined and maintained through
   generations. In most eukaryotes, centromere assembly and propagation
   are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Centromere Protein-A (CENP-A),
   a centromere-specific histone 3 variant, represents the most likely
   candidate for the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity.
   CENP-A provides a structural and functional foundation for the assembly
   of kinetochores. Defects in the regulation of CENP-A are catastrophic
   for cells and result in chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy, or
   an abnormal number of chromosomes, the hallmark of human cancers. We
   are currently using biochemical, genetic, cytological and genomic
   approaches to dissect the gene regulatory network mediating the
   faithful inheritance of centromeres.

   Post-doctoral and research assistant positions are available in Dr.
   Li‚s laboratory.

   Plant Systems Biology.  Our goal is to identify gene regulatory
   networks in plants using a combination of genetic, genomic,
   bioinformatic, and systems biological approaches. Our lab has two main
   areas of inquiry:  1. A systems approach to nitrogen networks & the

   A Systems Approach to Nitrogen Networks & the VirtualPlant.
   The long term goal of this project is to understand how internal and
   external perturbations affect gene regulatory networks that link plant
   metabolism and development. Succeeding in this endeavor will allow us
   to (1) explain mechanistically how changes in gene networks evoke
   systems-wide responses to external treatments such as nitrogen, and (2)
   to predict network states under untested conditions or in response to
   modifications. In the long term, this systems biology approach to gene
   networks should enable researchers to test the effects of
   biotechnological strategies for gene modifications in silico, prior to
   implementation in transgenic plants.  Our approach starts with the
   integration of all available information on Arabidopsis genomic data
   into a "multinetwork" where the "edges" connecting gene "nodes" are
   supported by multiple evidence including: metabolic pathway
   connections, protein:protein and protein:DNA interactions, microarray
   data, microRNA:target datasets, and literature-based interactions.  At
   present, the Arabidopsis multinetwork we have created  contains
   approximately 7,000 gene nodes and 230,000 interactions between them.
   As proof-of-principle, we have used this Arabidopsis multinetwork to
   identify the gene networks controlled by light, carbon and nitrogen
   signals.   In selected cases, the networks identified in wild-type
   plants have been validated using microarray data from Arabidopsis
   signaling mutants.  Our studies include analysis of gene networks in
   specific organs (leaves, roots or seeds) or in specific cell-types
   based on analysis of microarray data obtained from cell-sorted samples
   of roots.  The network analysis of gene lists generated from the
   microarray data in a network view is shown in Figure 1.

   The VirtualPlant Project.  In order to go beyond data integration to
   conceptual integration of genomic data, we recognize that scientists
   pattern recognition skills often lead to the most enduring qualitative
   biological insights. To support those skills in a data-rich
   environment, have implemented a set of data integration, analysis and
   visualization tools into a system called the "VirtualPlant"
   (www.virtualplant.org).   This system encompasses visualization
   techniques that render the multivariate genomic information in visual
   formats that facilitate the extraction of biological concepts and
   enable a "Systems Biology" view of the genomic data.  While our project
   relates specifically to Arabidopsis, the data structures, algorithms,
   and visualization tools we have developed have been designed in a
   species-independent fashion.  Thus, with the proper data uploads, the
   system can be used to visualize and model the molecular basis and
   underlying genomic responses in any organism for which genomic data is
   available.

   Comparative Genomics of Seed Evolution
   This NSF Plant Genome project (NSF DBI-0421604) involves the
   comparative genomic analysis of non-model, non-crop species, to uncover
   genes important to the evolution of seeds, an important agronomic
   trait. This project is being conducted with our partners in the NY
   Plant Genomic Consortium that include coPIs from NYU Biology (Coruzzi),
   NYU Courant (Shasha), NYBG (Stevenson), AMNH (DeSalle) and CSHL
   (McCombie & Martienssen).   Our approach is to generate and mine EST
   data from the the most primitive living-seed plants, the nodal
   Gymnosperms and the heterosporous lycophyte, Selaginella (as an
   outgroup), to resolve their phylogenetic relationship and to uncover
   novel genes and characters associated with the evolution and
   development of seeds. This project is being conducted collaboratively
   by scientists at three NY area institutions specializing in evolution,
   genomics and bioinformatics, who comprise The New York Plant Genomics
   Consortium (www.nypgenomics.org).  Participants in this project include
   PIs who collaborate in the training of post docs and graduate students
   from New York University, The New York Botanical Garden, Cold Spring
   Harbor, and The American Museum of Natural History.  We aim to achieve
   three goals:

   Research

   My research interests focus on gap junctions which are involved in
   cell-to-cell communication. Regulating the chemical and physical
   properties of gap junctions are the different connexin proteins. Unique
   communication compartments can be formed when gap junctions are
   assembled from various connexins.

   Presently, I am examining the implications of gap junctions on cell
   differentiation and development using the testis as a model. Organized
   in the seminiferous tubule and supported by Sertoli cells are some 63
   different germ cell types. The germ cells are arranged and organized in
   the seminiferous epithelium for an ordered development and
   differentiation into spermatozoa. We are currently determining gap
   junction‚s role in the formation of specific communication compartments
   and how gap junctions regulate and support specific spermatogenic
   cells. Gap junction assembly, connexin composition, and the chemical
   and physical properties of homotypic - heterotypic gap junctions will
   be examined biochemically and ultrastructurally.

   In the Carlton lab, we use the tools of comparative genomics ‚ whole
   genome sequencing and genomics, bioinformatics, molecular biology and
   population genetics ‚ to study the biology and evolution of closely
   related strains or species of parasite. In medicine and global public
   health, the term parasite is used to describe a group of eukaryotic
   microbes and helminths that cause some of the world‚s most devastating
   diseases. The parasites that we study include:

   (1) Species of the malaria parasite Plasmodium: more than half the
   world‚s population is at risk from malaria, and the disease causes ~216
   million cases and ~655,000 deaths per year. The most deadly form of the
   parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is found mostly in sub-Saharan Africa
   where it causes the deaths of children < 5 years old. Plasmodium vivax
   is the most common species outside Africa in South America and
   Southeast Asia, and is closely related to a group of species that
   infect Asian Old World monkeys from Taiwan to Sri Lanka, called the
   monkey malaria clade.

   Map of malaria distribution. Picture Credit: World Malaria Report 2005

   (2) The sexually transmitted parasite Trichomonas vaginalis and related
   trichomonads: T. vaginalis is the most common non-viral STI, and causes
   ~249 million cases per year world-wide. It is associated with increased
   risk of HIV-1 infection, and serious complications during pregnancy.
   Other trichomonads include Trichomonas tenax found in the mouth,
   Pentatrichomonas hominis a zoonotic gut parasite, and Tritrichomonas
   foetus a serious venereal pathogen that causes abortion in cattle.

   (3) Other fascinating parasites such as species of the enteric pathogen
   Cryptosporidium, the bovine parasite Theileria, and Babesia.

   Our research often begins with generation of a resource such as
   sequencing, assembly and annotation of a parasite‚s genome. For
   example, we have been involved in the sequencing of P. falciparum [1],
   species of rodent malaria (Plasmodium yoelii yoelii [2], Plasmodium
   chabaudi chabaudi and Plasmodium berghei [3]), several strains of P.
   vivax [4, 5], several strains of the monkey malaria Plasmodium
   cynomolgi [6], and the first T. vaginalis genome [7].

   Sequencing the genome of a parasite enables the complete gene and
   protein repertoire to be identified and provides a wealth of data about
   the basic biology of that organism, leading to hypothesis-driven
   studies. Generating sequences of multiple strains or species enables
   studies of whole genome evolution, genetic diversity and population
   genetics/genomics. Some of the research areas that members of the
   Carlton lab undertake in these areas include:

   Since many of the parasites we work on are important global public
   health problems in lower and middle income countries as well as poor
   regions of the United States, we collaborate with researchers and
   clinicians who work in public health clinics in order to move our
   research from the bench to the field. Some examples of our
   collaborations include:

   Behavioral genetics / Neurobiology / Circadian rhythms

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   How genes control animal behavior is the big question my lab is
   interested in. We mainly study circadian (~24hr) rhythms of behavior,
   arguably the best understood behavior at molecular and cellular levels.
   We use the fruitfly Drosophila as a powerful model system that has led
   the way in circadian rhythm research and is ideal for analyzing
   behavior at the level of single genes, single neurons, neuronal
   networks and whole animal behavior. We use Genetics, Genomics &
   BioInformatics, Microscopy and Behavioral assays to build a holistic
   model of how flies anticipate daily environmental changes.

   Adult flies have 24hr rhythms in their activity: they are more active
   by day, especially at dusk and dawn, and rest by night ‚ paralleling
   human sleep/wake cycles. These rhythms persist in constant darkness,
   indicating that flies have an internal sense of time. Forward genetics
   helped identify a set of core clock genes that are essential for 24hr
   rhythms in constant darkness, and these genes work together in
   transcription / translation feedback loops, forming "molecular clocks".

   A recent technical breakthrough we made has allowed us to obtain whole
   different times of day. These datasets are helping us understand the
   biology of these neurons by giving us insights into how LNvs control
   the timing of their output signals, novel signaling pathways involved
   in circadian rhythms and a system-level understanding of how LNv gene
   expression is altered in different electrical states.

   The larval clock neurons form a ‚minimal‚ circadian neural network with
   many fewer neurons than adult flies. We have been using this simplified
   circadian system to understand how clock neurons communicate to keep
   their molecular clocks synchronized with each other and to generate
   rhythmic behavior. The expectation is that what we learn in Drosophila
   will hold true for mammalian pacemaker neurons. Other projects ongoing
   in the lab include developing a novel decision-making paradigm in
   Drosophila.

   Developmental and evolutionary genomics of plants. The origin and
   genetic programming of cell types.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   The research in my lab focuses on two inter-related questions: How do
   multi-cellular organisms construct specialized cells and how do the
   genetic components of specialized cells change over evolutionary
   scales? The goal is to better understand how gene regulatory networks
   orchestrate cell maturation, a process that results in a set of highly
   specialized cell types. Thus, we focus on cellular differentiation,
   which is one of the key steps in organ formation and development in
   higher organisms. The approach of the lab combines genomics and
   molecular genetic tools. For example, we have pioneered a new technique
   to isolate cell types in plants using high-speed fluidics. From there,
   RNA from a specific cell type population is applied to microarrays to
   cell-specific regulators and infer properties of the genetic circuitry
   of cellular specification.

   Two experimental approaches are being used to address this larger
   question. The first project is large-scale reverse genetics guided by a
   detailed map of gene expression in the root and other organs. As a case
   study in cellular development, we have started to analyze knockouts of
   genes that are highly enriched in xylem, which are the water-conducting
   cells of the plant's vascular system. We also use computational
   approaches to generate testable hypotheses on the targets of
   transcription factors that control xylem maturation. The second project
   is creating detailed maps of gene expression in the roots of other
   plant species, such as rice. This will help us to track changes in gene
   expression during evolution. We can then ask how genetic networks have
   changed over time to create new cellular attributes and, occasionally,
   new cell types.

   Developmental systems biology.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   Our laboratory is interested in the integrative analysis of diverse
   functional genomics data to identify groups of genes that work in
   specific cellular and developmental processes. A major challenge in
   systems biology is how to extract meaningful biological insights from
   large heterogeneous data sets that probe different aspects of gene
   function. Several ongoing projects in the lab use integrative
   approaches to analyze and interpret large-scale datasets and to
   generate testable hypotheses on gene function in different biological
   systems. These projects all involve close collaborative interaction
   between experimental and computational scientists.

   Molecular networks in C. elegans early embryogenesis
   We have used an integrative approach to characterize gene networks that
   function in the very early C. elegans embryo, based on data from
   different kinds of functional genomics data that we and others have
   collected, such as protein-protein interactions, gene expression
   work in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Fabio Piano to
   systematically define genetic interactions in C. elegans early
   embryogenesis. Genetic interactions tell us about logical relationships
   between different cellular components, and we are analyzing how these
   functional dependencies complement other functional data that we
   already have in hand. The long-term goal of this work is to develop a
   global map of the molecular architecture underlying early development
   in C. elegans.

   the network is filtered for high-confidence functional links between
   genes (supported by two or more types of functional genomic data, e.g.
   phenotypic correlation and protein-protein interaction), a modular
   organization of molecular machinery is revealed, in which groups of
   highly interconnected genes are linked to each other via a small number
   of functional interactions. Adapted from Gunsalus et al., Nature 2005.

   Genetic requirements for mouse early embryogenesis
   We are collaborating with Dr. Nicole Noyes of the NYU School of
   Medicine to predict and analyze RNAi phenotypes in early mouse embryos
   using time-lapse microscopy. For this work, we are leveraging
   functional genomic data from several model organisms to identify
   candidate genes for RNAi that will help us define the spectrum of
   phenotypic defects that can occur in early mammalian embryos, similar
   to our previous work in C. elegans. One of the goals of this
   translational project is to develop a more sophisticated and
   non-invasive way to determine the developmental potential of human
   embryos for patients who seek reproductive assistance for infertility.

   Post-transcriptional gene regulation in C. elegans
   Regulation of mRNA localization, translation, and stability is
   increasingly recognized as in important layer in the regulation of gene
   activity in diverse biological systems. The modENCODE Consortium is an
   NIH/NHGRI initiative to identify and analyze functional elements in
   model organism genomes. As part of modENCODE, we are involved in the
   annotation of C. elegans 3‚UTRs and functional sequence elements
   contained in these regions. The goal of this work is to identify and
   test putative post-transcriptional regulatory networks in development.
   This project is a collaboration with Fabio Piano (PI), John Kim (U.
   Michigan, Co-PI), and Nikolaus Rajewsky (Center for Medical Systems
   Biology, Max Delbruck Center, Berlin, Co-PI).

   Interactive tools for functional genomic data
   As part of these projects, we develop web-based tools and graphical
   interfaces to provide the research community at large with enhanced
   access to and mining capabilities for large-scale functional genomic
   data. To facilitate a systems-level view of gene networks, we have
   developed a web-based network visualization tool called "N-Browse"
   neighborhoods and heterogeneous functional relationships in a modular
   way based on these integrated data. We have also developed a
   web-accessible database of RNA interference (RNAi) phenotypes in C.
   distribute data from large-scale RNAi studies and as an online notebook
   for ongoing high-content phenotypic analysis. In conjunction, we are
   developing strategies to make phenotypic data more amenable to
   computational analysis and tools to mine these data.

   Research

   The aim of our research is to understand phenotypic evolution by
   studying the processes by which the genetic networks underlying
   development diverge. A major feature of developmental networks is their
   robustness (Masel & Siegal 2009). That is, they are tolerant of both
   environmental and genetic perturbations. Our lab uses both experimental
   and computational approaches to understand the causes and evolutionary
   consequences of this robustness.

   One major experimental focus in our lab is on the process of sexual
   differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster and related flies. Sexual
   differentiation is a powerful model system for studying the evolution
   of development because many aspects of sexual morphology, physiology
   and behavior differ between closely related species, thereby enabling
   high-resolution comparative analysis. Despite this rapid divergence,
   sexual traits are highly robust within species and indeed are often
   diagnostic of species. We are using genomic and genetic approaches to
   identify and characterize regulatory pathways involved in genital
   development and function in D. melanogaster (e.g., Chatterjee et al.
   2011). This will lay the groundwork for determining how these robust
   pathways diverged between closely related species.

   A second major experimental focus is on directly identifying and
   characterizing genes that contribute to robustness of many traits. We
   have screened the genome of the laboratory yeast, Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, for genes whose deletion increases the variation in the
   morphologies of individual, genetically identical cells. Yeast is
   advantageous for this work because of its wealth of genetic and genomic
   resources, and because it lends itself to high-throughput analyses.
   Hundreds of yeast genes increase morphological variation when deleted,
   and these genes tend to be highly connected in cellular networks (Levy
   & Siegal 2008). We are currently testing whether the same genes also
   buffer genetic differences between cells, and whether the variation
   that is revealed by impairment of these genes is potentially
   beneficial. This work is complemented by theoretical investigations
   into the evolution of complex gene networks (e.g., Bergman & Siegal
   regulatory networks (e.g., Chen et al. 2010), which give us predictions
   to test experimentally.

   Research

   My current research is focused on the spatial dynamics of Lyme disease
   and other tick-borne pathogens in two different ecosystems.

   Spatial dynamics of ticks and tick-borne diseases in Dutchess County,
   NY
   In Dutchess County, an area where Lyme disease is endemic, we are
   interested in the spatial distribution of the black-legged tick, Ixodes
   scapularis, and potential environmental correlates. Additionally, we
   are studying the effects of host communities on Lyme disease and
   Anaplasmosis.

   Sudden Oak Death and Lyme disease in northern California
   Forest communities in northern California are being altered by Sudden
   Oak Death. The change in forest species composition and the creation of
   canopy gaps may affect the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus,
   and their hosts. We are studying how tick and host populations are
   influenced by Sudden Oak Death and the resulting affects on Lyme
   disease risk.

   Evolutionary and molecular causes of heritable variation in animals

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   Our goal is to understand the relationship between the molecular
   mechanisms that shape phenotypes within individuals and the
   evolutionary mechanisms that generate and maintain phenotypic variation
   within populations. This project requires that we identify the
   functional allelic variants that segregate in nature, understand their
   molecular mechanisms, characterize their population genetic dynamics,
   and build models that explain these dynamics in terms of molecular
   biology and ecology.

   We use molecular and quantitative genetics to discover the alleles that
   underlie phenotypic variation. Our primary model system is C. elegans,
   a bacteria-eating nematode widely distributed across the globe. Natural
   isolates of this species harbor variation for development, morphology,
   behavior, and physiology (indeed, for almost any trait we can measure).
   A particular focus of our research is the genetic basis of gene
   gene activity underlies development, genetic analysis of gene
   expression variation provides a unique window into the substrate of
   developmental evolution. Moreover, by measuring thousands of gene
   expression traits simultaneously, we can leverage their correlation
   structure to infer the causal networks that constitute the
   genotype-phenotype map, potentially a major shaper of phenotypic
   divergence.

   Our genome-scale analyses form the basis for our studies of the
   evolutionary causes of heritable variation. We are studying in
   particular the roles of dominance, epistasis, and linkage. C. elegans
   is an especially powerful system for studying the effects of linked
   selection because of its relatively low rate of outcrossing. We hope to
   study global patterns of epistasis by characterizing the additive and
   epistatic effects of large numbers of loci underlying gene expression
   traits that are under stabilizing selection. Alternate models for the
   mechanism of stabilizing selection ‚ compensatory evolution and
   fluctuating neutral space ‚ will be directly testable.

   To incorporate ecological context into our understanding of heritable
   variation, we are planning extensive field work to characterize spatial
   and temporal dynamics of functional allele frequencies in C. elegans.
   In parallel, we are initiating work on a new model system, a widely
   distributed polychaete species with abundant heritable variation for
   developmental phenotypes. We can collect the polychaetes from sites
   across the exceptional marine and estuarine setting of the New York
   area and we are developing molecular tools to discover the loci
   underlying developmental variation and their distributions in nature.

   Evolutionary and ecological genomics of plant adaptations

   We study the evolutionary forces that act in plant developmental
   networks at the species level, and in mapping and isolating genes that
   underlie natural variation in that are responsible for plant
   adaptation. We are also interested in exploring the ‚ecological
   transciptome‚ ‚ the dynamic gene networks found in plants in ecological
   environments. This work combines concepts and techniques in
   evolutionary and quantitative genomics, developmental biology,
   evolutionary ecology, and computational biology.

   Genetics of Plant Domestication

   Crops are plant species that have evolved in a cultural context to
   provide food and other products for human society. Crop species are
   fascinating subjects for evolutionary study, since they are examples of
   species that have undergone rapid diversification under intense
   selection pressures. They also permit us to understand the dynamic
   interface between genetics, evolution and human culture. We are
   studying the evolution of genes in rice (Oryza sativa). By using tools
   of molecular and evolutionary genomics, these studies provide insights
   into the processes and mechanisms that accompany cultural selection on
   plant species during domestication events.

   The Evolution of Multicellularity and Social Behaviour

   The model protist Dictyostelium discoideum has been a model for the
   study of social biology as well as the evolution of multicellularity.
   We are integrating techniques and approaches in population genetics,
   genomics, systems biology and glycomics to study kin discrimination and
   recognition in this social microbe.

   Work in my laboratory is funded by grants from the NSF Plant Genome
   Research program and the Population and Evolutionary Processes program.

   Earth history, evolution, causes of mass extinctions, volcanology

   My research spans many areas of the earth sciences, especially the
   inter-relationships between the Earth's changing environments and the
   evolution of life. A major long-term project involves the causes of
   mass extinctions, including the end-Cretaceous extinction 65 million
   years ago when the dinosaurs and many other forms of life died out. The
   evidence for a large asteroid or comet impact at that time led to work
   on a general theory of large-body impacts and mass extinctions,
   research into impact cratering and its environmental effects and into
   the possible astronomical causes for periodic comet showers in Earth's
   history. This work has taken me to impact craters and geologic
   boundaries on six continents. Recently, I have been focusing on the
   causes of the Permian/Triassic mass extinction (250 million years ago)
   - the most severe mass extinction of life - with field studies in
   Europe, Japan and South Africa.

   Another line of ongoing research has been an investigation of the role
   of volcanic eruptions in climatic change. This has involved study of
   volcanoes in Indonesia, and elsewhere around the globe. Of special
   interest are the largest explosive events that can produce severe
   'volcanic winter' episodes of cooling. These eruptions may have caused
   near-extinction in human evolutionary history and their reoccurrence
   can threaten civilization.

   Recent projects include computer modeling of biogeochemical cycles
   (carried out with Ken Caldeira at Lawrence - Livermore National
   Laboratory), and studies of global climate on time scales from decades
   (global warming) to hundreds of million of years (Snowball Earth)
   carried out with colleagues at NASA, Goddard Institute for Space
   Studies in NYC. I am also involved with observational studies of
   asteroids in collaboration with astronomers at Mt. Wilson Observatory
   in California.

   Gene function and mechanisms of gene regulation during Drosophila
   development.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   My research interests are in the area of gene regulation during
   embryonic development. I am studying the signal transduction pathway
   initiated by member of the TGF-√ superfamily Dpp in Drosophila
   melanogaster. Early in the development it acts as a morphogen similarly
   to activins and BMPs in vertebrate embryos. It controls the cell fates
   along the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo and anterior-posterior
   patterning of the adult appendages in a concentration dependent manner
   by eliciting differential transcriptional response from its target
   genes. Using molecular, biochemical and genetic analysis I am currently
   studying the promoter elements of Dpp terget genes and searching for
   coactivators and corepressors involved in their regulation. We are also
   investigating the mechanism of negative regulation of Dpp target genes
   by the gene brinker with a goal to uncover the general principles
   governing gene response to the embryonic morphogens.

   I teach Molecular Biology Lab I and II graduate courses. These are
   experimental classes, which cover a broad array of molecular biology

   Comparative and functional genomics of endospore-forming bacteria.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   Bacillus subtilis is a non-pathogenic soil bacterium and the prevalent
   model organism for all low GC Gram-positive bacteria. When B. subtilis
   cells are starved, they initiate a developmental program that
   culminates in the formation of highly resistant endospores (also
   referred to as spores). Endospore formation (sporulation) constitutes a
   relatively simple developmental system in which the generation of
   distinct cell types can be investigated experimentally. In previous
   work in the laboratory of Prof. Richard Losick at Harvard University,
   we have used a variety of genomics techniques to identify most, if not
   all, of the genes that are specifically turned on during the process of
   sporulation in B. subtilis. However, the function of many of these
   newly-identified genes remains undetermined.

   1. B. subtilis spore coat composition and assembly during sporulation

   In my laboratory, our characterization of newly-identified sporulation
   genes focuses on genes involved in the formation of the outermost
   structure of the mature spore: the spore coat. The coat is a
   proteinaceous shell surrounding the spore. It confers resistance to
   various chemicals and is required to maintain the structural integrity
   of the spore to avoid spontaneous spore germination. More than 30
   different coat proteins had been previously characterized in B.
   subtilis from classical genetic screens. In order to identify the
   complete repertoire of genes encoding coat proteins, we have performed
   a systematic program of gfp fusions to the sporulation genes that were
   identified in our transcriptional profiling experiments. The
   subcellular localization of all of the resulting protein fusions was
   investigated and as a result, 24 novel coat proteins have been
   identified. These fusions localize as rings or polar caps around the
   maturing forespore. We are also expressing all of the newly-generated
   fusions in cells mutant for genes involved in spore coat assembly. In
   parallel, we have observed by time-course microscopy that several of
   the novel coat proteins display dynamic patterns of spore coat
   localization. We would like to determine how these proteins affect
   subcellular localization of other coat proteins. The ultimate goal is
   to obtain a detailed assembly map of the entire developing spore coat.

   Dr. Bonneau focuses on two main categories of computational biology:
   learning networks from functional genomics data and predicting and

   key roles in achieving critical field-wide milestones. In the area of
   structure prediction he was one of the early authors on the Rosetta
   code, which was one of the first codes to demonstrate accurate and
   comprehensive ability to predict protein structure in the absence of
   sequence homology. His lab has also made key contributions to the areas
   of genomics data analysis. They focus on two main areas: 1) methods for

   Inferelator) , and 2) methods that learn condition dependent
   co-regulated groups from integrations of different genomics data-types
   (integrative biclustering). His lab strives to develop new methods that

   Having an extra or missing a copy of a chromosome is detrimental for
   normal cells. Despite this, X chromosome exists in different copy
   numbers in males (XY) and females (XX), thus presenting a significant
   biological challenge. In many animals, this challenge is met by protein
   complexes that equalize X-chromosome transcript levels between males
   and females. These complexes are called the ‚dosage compensation
   complexes‚, and are targeted specifically to the X chromosome and alter
   chromatin structure to regulate transcription. We study C. elegans
   dosage compensation as a model to understand chromosome-wide regulation
   of chromatin structure and transcription. Our research is currently

   Spatial control of gene transcription during early Drosophila
   development

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   Research Interests:

   In many cases, different parts of each gene‚s transcription pattern are
   controlled by cis-acting regulatory elements (enhancers) that contain
   binding sites for factors positioned higher in the hierarchy. By
   understanding how these elements work, we hope to understand the
   molecular mechanisms involved in position-specific activation and
   repression of transcription. Since many of the transcription factors we
   study in fruit flies are evolutionarily similar to factors in higher
   eukaryotes, understanding how they work in Drosophila should provide us
   with profound insights into developmental mechanisms in other insects
   and higher animals including humans.

   Current Projects:

   In our first experiments, we have used genetic experiments to flatten
   the Bcd gradient, and then measured the amounts of Bcd required for
   activating specific target genes. Surprisingly, we have found that all
   tested target genes can be activated by lower concentrations than those
   present in the wild type gradient where boundaries for those genes are
   formed. These results suggest that Bcd concentrations are in excess at
   each position within the wild type gradient, which challenges the
   strict interpretation of the morphogen hypothesis. Our working
   hypothesis is that there are repressors that interfere with
   Bcd-dependent activation, and that combinations of activating and
   repressing proteins position and register multiple target gene
   expression boundaries.

   We are using an integrated approach in pursuit of this goal. First, we
   use bio-informatics methods and published ChIP-Chip data to identify
   all clusters of Bicoid-binding sites that are similar to those in the
   known target genes. Candidate clusters are cloned into reporter genes,
   transformed into the genome, and tested for in vivo activity by in situ
   hybridization experiments.

   While collecting an ever-growing number of Bcd-dependent elements, we
   are using data mining techniques to identify sequence motifs or binding
   site arrangements that correlate with target gene positioning. Among
   the most over-represented sites in a specific group of enhancers
   appears to be a binding site for the Run transcription factor, which is
   expressed in a gradient that spatially opposes the Bcd gradient. We are
   currently testing this hypothesis using genetic, biochemical, and
   transgenic assays.

   Defining Functions of Individual Bicoid Target Genes. How individual
   Bicoid target genes function in anterior patterning has been impossible
   to address because removal of Bicoid function abolishes the expression
   of all target genes. However, in recent years, we have developed a
   transgenic system for expressing an anterior gradient of any protein in
   embryos lacking Bicoid altogether. This approach is being used to
   systematically assay the activities of the known target genes. Our
   results suggest that some genes are involved primarily in repressing
   posterior organizing genes in the presumptive head regions, while
   others are involved in transducing the specific instructive activities
   that lead to the formation of individual anterior segments. These
   studies are particular interesting in light of the fact that the bicoid
   gene is not well conserved, even among insects.

   We are currently focused on a 500 bp enhancer element that forms two
   stripes (eve 3 and eve 7) in the early embryo (Figure 4). So far we
   have identified more than 25 binding sites in this enhancer. By
   manipulating these sequences and the spacing between them in detail, we
   hope to further augment our understanding of how these DNA sequences
   integrate the combined effects of different combinations of regulatory
   factors.

   These projects are currently funded by grants from the NIH and NYU‚s
   Research Challenge Fund.

   Molecular mechanisms underlying early development in Drosophila

   Transcriptional activation of the early Drosophila genome

   Untitled1.png The broad goal of my research program is to understand
   the molecular mechanisms that control early embryonic development. We
   use genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches to study gene
   regulatory networks in the early Drosophila embryo. Initially the
   embryo relies on maternally deposited gene products to begin
   developing, and the transition to reliance on its own zygotic-gene
   activity is called the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT
   represents a major cellular reprogramming event whereby thousands of
   maternal RNAs are degraded and hundreds of new zygotic RNAs are
   transcribed during the time between egg fertilization and blastoderm
   formation. Recently we discovered a key transcriptional regulator
   called Zelda, which plays a key role in this reprogramming event. Our
   goal is to understand how Zelda mediates the rapid and robust
   activation of the zygotic genome and how it works together with the
   other key transcription factors to prepare the embryo for major
   developmental processes such as gastrulation and tissue
   differentiation.

   Currently, the major project in the lab aims to understand how Zelda
   functions at the mechanistic level. Zelda is a zinc-finger
   transcription factor, and binds to CAGGTAG and related sites (Liang et
   al., 2008). Interestingly, our genome-wide binding analysis
   (ChIP-chip/seq) showed that Zelda binds to known enhancers in the early
   embryo to such an extent that Zelda binding is a predictive indicator
   of the location of an enhancer (Nien et al., 2012). Zelda is the major
   Zelda binds enhancers well before the gene is activated (Harrision et
   pioneer factor, a special class of transcription factors that bind
   target sites in chromatin, allowing other factors access to enhancers
   (reviewed in Zaret and Carroll, 2011). In this way, Zelda may
   potentiate the activity of other transcription factors such as the
   patterning morphogens, an exciting hypothesis that points to the
   significance of Zelda function in embryonic patterning. We believe that
   Zelda works together with morphogens, and though we do not yet know how
   they interact, one fact is clear - that without Zelda, morphogens
   cannot function to their full potential, particularly when at low
   concentrations, and target genes are not activated at the right time
   and in the right place. Mechanistically, Zelda may act as a beacon on
   chromatin for other transcription factors. Without Zelda, these factors
   may not position correctly, and redistribute to other regions of the
   genome. In collaboration with the Zeitlinger lab at Stowers Institute,
   we are examining the chromatin landscape in wild type and zelda mutant
   embryos to determine how Zelda cooperates with other key regulators
   during the MZT.

   A second Zelda project stems from the observation that Zelda is
   expressed in older embryos and larva, specifically in imaginal discs
   and the brain. For example in the eye disc and optic lobe of the brain,
   Zelda is expressed in the undifferentiated cells and is down-regulated
   upon differentiation. In the opitc lobe neuroepithelium, which
   comprises stem cells that give rise to neuroblasts/neurons, loss of
   Zelda causes premature differentiation. We propose that Zelda
   establishes the neural stem cell gene network, which prepares cells for
   the neuropeithelial to neuroblast transition.

   The projects in the my lab require the use of several types of
   approaches from manipulating genes and transgenes and observing the
   output phenotypes, to systems/genome-wide studies that require
   bioinformatic analysis. We also collaborate with systems biologist Stas
   Shvartsman, who models Zelda interactions with the patterning
   morphogens. Together these approaches will allow an understanding of
   how global factors like Zelda interact with key regulators to control
   robust expression of the early zygotic genome.

   I teach the undergraduate Genetics course. I participate in team-taught
   graduate lecture courses: Biocore I and II (the graduate core classes),
   and Developmental Genetics. I also run a graduate seminar, Current
   Topics in Genetics. In addition, I mentor several undergraduate
   students for their independent studies in the lab and their honors
   theses, as well as several Master's students for their Lab in Molecular
   Biology courses and Master's theses.

   I received my Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut in 1983. My
   thesis mentor was Dr. Arthur Chovnick, a well known geneticist who
   studied gene organization in Drosophila. I moved to the laboratory of
   Dr. David Ish-Horowicz at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London,
   England to study developmental biology. I was particularly interested
   in the problem of cell fate determination. In 1986, I moved to Dr.
   Michael Levine's laboratory at Columbia University to study the problem
   of how morphogen gradients control cell fate. We discovered that the
   dorsal morphogen gradient is created by the mechanism of regulated
   nuclear transport.

   In 1991 I started my own lab at the Roche Institute of Molecular
   Biology in New Jersey where I showed how the dorsal morphogen acts as a
   transcriptional repressor to control target gene expression. In 1995 I
   joined the faculty of New York University as an associate professor and
   was tenured in 1999. We have been studying how Dpp functions as a
   morphogen and how it differs from the classical morphogens Dorsal and
   Bicoid. We showed that feed forward motifs predominate in how Dpp
   regulates downstream target genes rather than the differential binding
   affinity mechanism.

   My research revolves around proteins, their properties, evolution, and
   expression patterns. I am a systems biologist who uses statistical and
   computational tools, large-scale quantitative mass spectrometry, and
   molecular biology techniques to study the dynamics of the cellular
   proteome.

   Quantitative shotgun proteomics

   fig1.png Until recently, it was impossible to accurately estimate the
   absolute and relative concentrations of thousands of proteins in
   complex biological samples. Our quantitative proteomics technology
   called APEX (Absolute Protein Expression Index, Nature Biotech, 2007
   25(1)) allows us to do so ‚ for everything from bacteria to yeast and
   human. Mass spectrometry data is highly complex, and we continuously
   improve our data mining methods with respect to the identification and
   quantification of proteins. For example, in MSpresso and MSnet
   (Bioinformatics 2009a, b), we use mRNA expression data and protein
   functional network information, respectively, to increase the number of
   proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry analysis.

   The dynamics of protein expression

   The expression levels of proteins are determined by transcription,
   translation, mRNA and protein stability, and these processes are
   regulated by a plethora of mechanisms. Thus, the relationship between
   protein and mRNA expression levels varies across organisms and sets of
   proteins (Mol BioSystems, 2009 5(12)). Using yeast and human cell
   lines, we characterize the proteome and transcriptome under normal
   conditions and in response to stimuli. Time course data allows us to
   describe cellular processes as dynamical systems and will enable us to
   better understand protein expression regulation ‚ both mathematically
   and biologically.

   Proteomics characterization of translation regulators

   The human genome encodes ~600 proteins with RNA-binding domains, and
   many of these proteins are putative translation regulators. Using
   quantitative proteomics approaches and complementary molecular biology
   techniques, we characterize the impact of RNA-binding proteins on the
   'translation regulatory network'. One example is Musashi-1 which is a
   key regulator involved in brain tumor formation, and we analyze its
   impact on the human proteome and transcriptome. This project is carried
   out in collaboration with Luiz Penalva (UTexas San Antonio).

   embryo to the Drosophila visual system.

   Research

   Our laboratory focuses on two major developmental questions: The
   evolution of early embryonic development and the establishment of
   retinal and brain circuitry that underlies color vision. These distinct
   systems represent paradigms for understanding how pattern formation is
   genetically controlled.

   * The first project is an Evo-Devo approach to the earliest steps of
   insect development, the formation of the antero-posterior embryonic
   axis. In flies, the morphogenetic gradient of the Bicoid protein is
   essential for anterior development. However, bicoid is not conserved
   and is a newly evolved gene that has taken over the ancestral function.
   We are using the wasp Nasonia as an alternate model system to study how
   a very distant species patterns its axis. Nasonia is a Hymenoptera that
   diverged from Diptera over [fig_1.jpg] 200MY ago but exhibits a long
   germband mode of development similar to flies. The genome of Nasonia is
   sequenced and there are early developmental mutants and parental RNAi
   to address gene function. We have shown that Nasonia, like flies,
   utilizes an anterior morphogenetic center to generate the patterning
   information required for the formation of all segments but uses
   localized otd instead of bcd mRNA. Our ongoing investigations attempt
   to understand the entire segmentation pattern in Nasonia, with the goal
   of reaching the same level of mechanistic detail as in Drosophila.

   * The other system that we study is the determination of the retinal
   mosaic that underlies color vision in flies. Color vision is achieved
   through the comparison in the brain of inputs coming from
   photoreceptors containing rhodopsins with different wavelength
   specificity. Different rhodopsins are expressed in stochastic but
   mutually [fig_2.jpg] exclusive patterns in the compound eye of
   Drosophila as in cones of the vertebrate retina. A given rhodopsin gene
   is stochastically chosen, leading to repression of all others. Another
   mechanism must then inform the brain of its connection to a
   photoreceptor with a given color sensitivity. We have used molecular
   and genetic approaches to decipher the genetic network that controls
   the specification of the 8 types of photoreceptors that form the
   retinal mosaic.

   * Visual information is processed in the optic lobes. Two types of
   photoreceptors mediate motion detection or color discrimination by
   projecting to lamina (motion) or medulla (color) parts of the optic
   lobes. We focus our attention on the medulla that contains a finite
   number of neurons and serves as a paradigm to understand the
   development and function of a sophisticated neural structure. We have
   defined 70 medulla cell types: projection neurons, local interneurons,
   columnar neurons (that contact photoreceptors from each unit eye), and
   non-columnar neurons (that contact termini from several unit eyes).
   These neurons form overlapping retinotopic maps before projecting to
   the lobula complex or back to the lamina. We study how medulla neuron
   diversity is generated and how these neurons establish their
   retinotopic connections to photoreceptors. Neuronal specification
   appears to result from the integration of three mechanisms: (i)
   Neuroblasts sequentially acquire distinct identity and produce unique
   diversifies their daughter cells (iii) regionalization of the medulla
   modifies the neuroblast program for further neuronal diversity. We use
   this knowledge together with electrophysiology and behavior assays to
   investigate how neuronal types function in the motion and chromatic
   pathways.

   My research in computational biology and neuroscience integrates data
   from experimental studies, theoretical analysis, mathematical modeling,
   and computer simulation.

   One of my ongoing projects, in vertebrate phototransduction, focuses on
   light adaptation in rods and cones, and on the reproducibility of rod
   responses to single photons.  Electrophysiological and biochemical data
   provide a basis for developing mathematical models that account for
   light adaptation and statistical properties of the singe-photon
   response in terms of the molecular mechanisms underlying
   phototransduction.

   Another ongoing project involves the development of "statistical
   mechanical" methods for modeling large neural networks.  These methods
   employ the theory of the probability (population) density function.
   Factors that make conventional methods unwieldy or intractable -
   thousands of neurons and millions of synapses ¬¨are used to great
   advantage in these methods. Similar neurons are lumped together into
   populations, and one tracks the distribution of neurons over state
   space in each population.  The state of a neuron is determined by the
   dynamic variables in the underlying single-neuron model.  The
   population-firing rate is given by the flux of probability across a
   particular surface in state space. Neurons are coupled via stochastic
   neuron is determined by the rate of action potentials in each of the
   presynaptic populations and by the average number of synapses the
   postsynaptic neuron receives from each of these populations.

   In an ongoing collaboration with Arjun Raj at the University of
   Pennsylvania, I am analyzing and modeling stochastic gene expression.
   The models include gene switching, synthesis and degradation of mRNA
   and proteins, and cell divisions. A goal is to understand sources of
   large fluctuations in the number of transcripts from genes that are
   expressed at low levels, the consequences for protein levels, and the
   implications for cell fate and cell physiology in general. Future
   modeling will focus on gene networks.

   Finally, I am collaborating with Professor Gloria Coruzzi and her lab
   on projects involving the identification and modeling of gene
   regulatory networks underlying nitrogen assimilation and metabolism in
   Arabidopsis. Statistical analysis of microarray, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq
   data plays a central role in these projects.

   Evolution of development, molecular systematics, and developmental
   genetics of the male tail in nematodes related to C. elegans.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   Using the developmental genetic model system Caenorhabditis elegans, we
   are characterizing genes responsible for morphogenesis, a collection of
   fundamental developmental mechanisms that shape and organize cells into
   particular forms. C. elegans is used for this study because it is
   complex enough to share components and mechanisms of more complex
   multicellular animals, but is simple enough to be described in complete
   terms. The structure we are using as a model for morphogenesis is the
   sexually dimorphic tail tip. This simple feature is constructed of only
   4 cells that, in males only, fuse very late in juvenile ("larval")
   development and change their cellular structure and position. This
   results in a blunt shape (the pointy shape of the hermaphrodite tail
   results from lack of morphogenetic change). We've finished a complete
   transmission electron microscopic reconstruction of these cellular
   events using serial sections, providing a descriptive foundation for
   further functional studies. We have isolated several mutations that
   fail at certain steps of male tail tip morphogenesis, and are currently
   cloning the genes defined by these mutations to understand their
   molecular functions.

   [TailTipCellsS.gif]
   Figure: Model of the 4tail tip cells in a C. elegans larva (cuticle
   removed). Click for a larger image.

   Evolutionary changes in the development of the tail tip have also
   occurred. Using molecular phylogenetic analysis in combination with a
   developmental genetic approach, we are reconstructing the developmental
   changes that have occurred in male tails during the evolution of family
   Rhabditidae (of which C. elegans is a member). So far we have found
   several mutations that closely mimic evolutionary changes, suggesting
   candidate genes that could have been involved in evolutionary changes.
   These investigations will provide specific information about the genes
   and processes conserved in morphogenetic mechanisms as well as insight
   into the ways that these mechanisms can change to produce variation in
   multicellular form.

   The interaction of mammalian RNA polymerases with damaged sites in
   expressed genes

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   The research in my laboratory primarily involves the study of
   interactions of chemical and physical agents with DNA, and the
   processing of the resulting damage by cells. To that end, we have been
   examining the removal of chemical adducts from discrete regions of the
   genome. This is being done in an effort to characterize a phenomenon
   known as DNA repair heterogeneity that is typified by the preferential
   removal of DNA damage from active genetic loci. The implications of
   biases in DNA repair are vast: Certain segments of the chromosome might
   be more susceptible to mutagenesis than other domains, making them hot
   spots for the induction of a variety of detrimental biological outcomes
   including tumorigenesis and cell death.

   A second area of ongoing research involves investigating the effect of
   site-specific DNA damage on transcription by a variety of RNA
   polymerases. We use oligonucleotides containing polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, an important class of chemical carcinogens, for these
   studies. We have shown that some of these adducts impede transcription
   stereochemical configuration of the DNA lesion.

   As a consequence of the antiparallel arrangement of the two strands of
   the DNA double helix and the 5'-3' polarity of DNA polymerases, DNA
   replication is intrinsically asymmetric. Only one parental strand at
   the replication fork can be continuously replicated: the other -- the
   lagging strand -- is discontinuously synthesized via the iterative
   generation, processing and ligation of Okazaki fragments to generate an
   intact daughter strand.

   Figure 1

   Lagging-strand synthesis requires a coordinated sequence of several
   enzymatic activities (Fig. 1). Each Okazaki fragment is (i) initiated
   by Pola/primase and (ii) subsequently extended by DNA polymerase d
   finally, (iv) DNA ligase joins the fragment to the nascent daughter
   strand. My lab is interested in several broad questions related to the
   regulation and coordination of lagging-strand synthesis, which we
   investigate using a combined genetic, biochemical and genomic approach
   in the model yeast S. cerevisiae.

   I graduated from Cambridge University in 2004 with a B.A. in Natural
   Sciences, and immediately moved to New York to pursue a Ph.D. at The
   Rockefeller University. At Rockefeller I worked with Magda Konarska,
   investigating the determinants of substrate specificity during pre-mRNA
   splicing while maintaining a side-interest in the intrinsic catalytic
   potential of RNA. In 2009 I moved across York Avenue to join Iestyn
   Iestyn, I developed genomics techniques to study lagging-strand
   synthesis in vivo in budding yeast. I started my lab at NYU in
   September 2013.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   Classical studies of molecular biology revealed how cells sense their
   environment and respond to change, establishing the centrality of gene
   regulation in cellular physiology. Numerous mechanisms in bacteria,
   however, function in a largely deregulated way, generating a diversity
   of responses across the population, without necessarily sensing the
   environment. The existence of such stochastic mechanisms raises several
   (increasingly difficult) questions: (1) How do microorganisms employ
   stochasticity to their advantage? (2) Can we distinguish such adaptive
   stochasticity from useless noise that is simply too costly for cells to
   avoid? (3) How, and under what circumstances, do sensing mechanisms
   evolve? My research employs theoretical and computational modeling of
   bacteria populations in fluctuating environments, and comparative
   genomics of experimentally-characterized stochastic switches.

   Closely related topics of research include the evolution of mutation
   rates, mutator phenotypes, and mutational hotspots in genomes. My other
   interests include protein folding and protein evolution.

   I received my Ph.D in Biophysics from Harvard University, where I
   worked with Eugene Shakhnovich on physical aspects of protein folding,
   including relaxation dynamics and packing of protein sidechains,
   high-resolution Monte Carlo simulation of folding, and theory related
   to protein evolution. I went on to do post-doctoral work with Stanislas
   Leibler at The Rockefeller University where, starting with simple
   models of antibiotic persistence in E. coli, we worked towards
   understanding in some generality the evolutionary advantage of
   stochastic phenotype switches in microorganisms. We eventually found
   that these mechanisms are intimately connected with information
   acquisition in a general sense, and that in certain cases the
   evolutionary advantage of phenotype switching can be expressed in
   purely information theoretic terms. I joined the NYU faculty in the
   Department of Biology in September 2006, where I am working on theory
   and modeling of evolution in microorganisms.

   Neuroplasticity of the brain regulated by neuronal serotonin and glial
   S-100 protein

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   The morphology of brain cells in the adult brain is in constant flux
   due to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. In experimental animals, the
   mature phenotype of neurons can be lost in the adult brain when trophic
   factors are withdrawn, and reestablished upon replacement. We have been
   studying reversible brain changes for over 20 years and recently
   proposed a model based on neuronal instability to explain these
   changes. The shape of a cell, whether neuronal or glial, is dependent
   on the integrity of the cytoskeleton composed mainly of microtubules
   and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs). MAPs function to sta-bilize
   the tubulin polymers. When the MAPs are phosphorylated, they can no
   longer attach to the polymers, and the long strands of tubulin
   depolymerize. This results in a collapse of the cellular morphology,
   e.g. dendritic and process retraction. S100b is a soluble glial protein
   concentrated in neurons, which protects MAPs from phos-phorylation. We
   have shown that the addition of S100b stabilizes and promotes the
   extension of dendritic processes.Serotonin, acting on the 5-HT1A high
   affinity receptor, can stimulate the release of S100b from astrocytes.
   recpt_small.jpg Glucocorticoids, secreted during stress, can enhance
   serotonin turnover and adrenalectomy has the opposite effect of
   reducing serotonin activity. Both adrenalectomy (removing source of
   glucocorticoids) or depletion of serotonin (by injecting the
   substituted amphetamines or specific synthesis inhibitors) have been
   found to reduce dendritic staining and synapse number in hippocampus
   and cortex. This reduction of mature neuronal morphology is rapidly
   reversible upon replacement of steroids or serotonin. Others have found
   similar examples of retraction and expansion manipulating estrogen,
   dopamine, norepinephrine and NGF. We propose a model of neuronal
   instability to explain these reversible changes in neuronal shape and
   connections. Our results obtained in experimental animals may have
   applicability to brain volumetric and neurophilic changes seen in
   alcoholism, anorexia nervosa, Alzheimer's and depression. As is evident
   in the hibernating ground squirrel or cycling female rat, loss of
   dendrites may represent a normal response of a cell to a changing
   trophic environment, which could represent healthy plasticity rather
   than irreversible pathology.

   RESEARCH

   Embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation has the potential to be
   instrumental in cell based therapies and in vitro disease modeling and
   chemical screens. To fulfill those expectations, ESCs have to be
   directed at high efficiency to disease relevant cell types, either by
   the application of extracellular signals or direct programming by
   forced expression of transcription factors. Therefore, our long term
   goal is to understand how extracellular signals and transcription
   factors control cell fate and apply that knowledge to differentiate ESC
   into disease relevant neuronal cell types.

   Mechanisms of direct neuronal programming Recent advances in cell
   programming demonstrated that terminal cell fate can be established by
   a handful of selector transcription factors. To understand cell
   differentiation and to gain control of cell fate during direct
   programming, it is necessary to rationalize how selector factors
   recognize their genomic targets and control gene expression. The
   plastic genetic state of ESC is particularly receptive to the
   programming activity of transcription factors. Therefore, the
   expression of few factors programs ESC into neurons at high efficiency
   allowing us to apply biochemical interrogation techniques to study gene
   expression, physiological properties, chromatin status and genomic
   occupancy of transcription factors. Preliminary data suggests that
   programming transcription factors synergize to activate cell-specific
   transcriptional programs. Thus, instead of ‚selector genes,‚ ‚selector
   cassettes‚ are the functional units controlling cell fate. We hope to
   derive rules that allow the rational design of programming selector
   cassettes.

   Hox gene function during motor neuron differentiation The central
   nervous system is composed by a myriad of neuronal types and subtypes
   that are essential for proper connectivity and function. However, the
   subtype identity is rarely controlled during ESC directed
   differentiation or cellular programming. Therefore, successful in vitro
   differentiation protocols to be applied either for cell based therapies
   or disease modeling should produce neurons with defined generic and
   subtype identity. During in vivo and in vitro differentiation, members
   of the Hox family of transcription factors impose subtype identity and
   control motor neuron (MN) connectivity. Thus, understanding how Hox
   genes interact and synergize with MN resident factors to control
   subtype identity is the key to manipulating MN identity. Based on
   phenotypic characterization, expression analysis and ChIP-seq of Hox
   genes during in vitro MN differentiation, we plan to identify the
   enhancer structure at Hox binding sites and to establish the minimal
   set of cofactors and molecular logic required for Hox gene activity in
   MNs. The final measure of our understanding of Hox gene activity will
   be the direct generation of precise MN subtypes at will.

   Generation of cells relevant for human neurodegenerative diseases In
   vitro differentiation of human ESC has the potential to serve as a
   ‚humanized‚ platform to study complex neurodegenerative diseases.
   Current protocols based on human stem cells are inefficient and/or take
   several weeks and are thus inappropriate for large-scale phenotypic
   characterization and drug screens. We take advantage of sets of
   transcription factors that program mouse ESC to two types of human
   neurons with different sensitivities to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
   (ALS). These cells would become an in vitro human model to investigate
   intrinsic resistance to ALS. Comparing the transcriptomic and
   epigenomic landscapes of these two cell types under normal and stressed
   conditions might yield insight into new approaches to treat
   neurodegenerative diseases. In the future, both cell types can be the
   substrate for chemical screens to identify molecules that enhance MN
   survival.

   Genomics, genetics and evolution of early C. elegans development.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   We study the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms underlying early
   embryonic development using a combination of molecular genetic and
   functional genomics approaches in the animal model C. elegans and
   related nematodes. One of our major goals is to use RNA interference
   (RNAi) of ovary-expressed genes followed by time-lapse microscopy to
   work toward a comprehensive molecular description of early
   embryogenesis in C. elegans. RNAi offers a powerful way to obtain
   information about the loss-of-function phenotype of the genes tested,
   while the early embryo offers a system in which basic cellular and
   developmental processes can be easily studied. We currently have tested
   over 1,000 genes and identified about 300 genes required for
   embryogenesis. Although most of these genes are highly conserved, fewer
   than 10% have been identified in previous genetic screens. We use the
   data obtained from the RNAi tests to build gene clusters based on
   phenotypic analysis. The clusters are then used to guide two broad
   lines of investigation: (1) functional analysis of the genome, and (2)
   molecular dissection of specific cellular processes.

   From the initial clustering studies, we have found groups of genes
   required for basic processes such as nuclear movements, mitotic spindle
   formation, cytokinesis, cell cycle progression, and proper asymmetric
   cell division. In many cases, these clusters contain genes that are
   conserved in humans. However, their function in humans is not yet
   known. Therefore, our data can be used not only to analyze the C.
   elegans genome but also to guide the functional examination of the
   human genome. In our current dataset we have already found genes for
   which the human homolog is associated with a genetic disease, including
   some that have been previously targeted for anti-cancer drug
   development.

   In a related project we are using the early nematode embryo as a model
   to study the evolution of developmental mechanisms. Comparisons across
   species have revealed fundamental differences during early
   embryogenesis. Significantly, in some species the wild-type patterns of
   early cleavages resemble those produced by various C. elegans mutants.
   We are examining these phenotypic differences in conjunction with
   molecular analyses to identify mechanisms underlying the phenotypic
   diversity seen in nature.

   epigenetics, epigenomics, chromatin

   Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in phenotype that occur
   without changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms are essential
   for many cellular processes, such as gene-expression regulation, genome
   organization and cell-fate determination. Defects in epigenetic
   regulation have been implicated in a variety of diseases, including
   cancer. The aim of our research is to understand the fundamental
   principles of epigenetic regulation. Toward this goal, we have chosen
   to study the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), a model
   eukaryotic organism well suited to a combination of powerful
   experimental approaches, including genetics, cell biology, biochemistry
   and genomics. Importantly, fission yeast contains many conserved
   epigenetic components, and has thus emerged as a premier model for
   epigenetic study.

   Epigenetic Regulation of Heterochromatin
   In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged together with histone proteins into an
   ordered, highly complex chromatin structure. Chromatin exists in two
   forms: euchromatin and heterochromatin. Euchromatin is typically
   transcriptionally active and loosely packaged, whereas heterochromatin
   is gene-poor and appears highly compact throughout the cell cycle.
   Heterochromatin is a classic example of epigenetic phenomena and plays
   an important role in gene regulation, chromosome segregation and genome
   stability. Taking advantage of powerful genetic and biochemical
   approaches available in fission yeast, we have identified multiple key
   heterochromatin factors. We aim to understand the epigenetic mechanisms
   that regulate establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin.

   Epigenetic Regulation of Centromeres
   Centromeres are specific chromosomal loci where the kinetochore, a
   multiprotein complex, is assembled. Kinetochores mediate attachment of
   spindle microtubules to centromeres, ensuring proper segregation of
   chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. A fundamental question in
   biology is how centromere identity is defined and maintained through
   generations. In most eukaryotes, centromere assembly and propagation
   are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Centromere Protein-A (CENP-A),
   a centromere-specific histone 3 variant, represents the most likely
   candidate for the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity.
   CENP-A provides a structural and functional foundation for the assembly
   of kinetochores. Defects in the regulation of CENP-A are catastrophic
   for cells and result in chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy, or
   an abnormal number of chromosomes, the hallmark of human cancers. We
   are currently using biochemical, genetic, cytological and genomic
   approaches to dissect the gene regulatory network mediating the
   faithful inheritance of centromeres.

   Post-doctoral and research assistant positions are available in Dr.
   Li‚s laboratory.

   Plant Systems Biology.  Our goal is to identify gene regulatory
   networks in plants using a combination of genetic, genomic,
   bioinformatic, and systems biological approaches. Our lab has two main
   areas of inquiry:  1. A systems approach to nitrogen networks & the

   A Systems Approach to Nitrogen Networks & the VirtualPlant.
   The long term goal of this project is to understand how internal and
   external perturbations affect gene regulatory networks that link plant
   metabolism and development. Succeeding in this endeavor will allow us
   to (1) explain mechanistically how changes in gene networks evoke
   systems-wide responses to external treatments such as nitrogen, and (2)
   to predict network states under untested conditions or in response to
   modifications. In the long term, this systems biology approach to gene
   networks should enable researchers to test the effects of
   biotechnological strategies for gene modifications in silico, prior to
   implementation in transgenic plants.  Our approach starts with the
   integration of all available information on Arabidopsis genomic data
   into a "multinetwork" where the "edges" connecting gene "nodes" are
   supported by multiple evidence including: metabolic pathway
   connections, protein:protein and protein:DNA interactions, microarray
   data, microRNA:target datasets, and literature-based interactions.  At
   present, the Arabidopsis multinetwork we have created  contains
   approximately 7,000 gene nodes and 230,000 interactions between them.
   As proof-of-principle, we have used this Arabidopsis multinetwork to
   identify the gene networks controlled by light, carbon and nitrogen
   signals.   In selected cases, the networks identified in wild-type
   plants have been validated using microarray data from Arabidopsis
   signaling mutants.  Our studies include analysis of gene networks in
   specific organs (leaves, roots or seeds) or in specific cell-types
   based on analysis of microarray data obtained from cell-sorted samples
   of roots.  The network analysis of gene lists generated from the
   microarray data in a network view is shown in Figure 1.

   The VirtualPlant Project.  In order to go beyond data integration to
   conceptual integration of genomic data, we recognize that scientists
   pattern recognition skills often lead to the most enduring qualitative
   biological insights. To support those skills in a data-rich
   environment, have implemented a set of data integration, analysis and
   visualization tools into a system called the "VirtualPlant"
   (www.virtualplant.org).   This system encompasses visualization
   techniques that render the multivariate genomic information in visual
   formats that facilitate the extraction of biological concepts and
   enable a "Systems Biology" view of the genomic data.  While our project
   relates specifically to Arabidopsis, the data structures, algorithms,
   and visualization tools we have developed have been designed in a
   species-independent fashion.  Thus, with the proper data uploads, the
   system can be used to visualize and model the molecular basis and
   underlying genomic responses in any organism for which genomic data is
   available.

   Comparative Genomics of Seed Evolution
   This NSF Plant Genome project (NSF DBI-0421604) involves the
   comparative genomic analysis of non-model, non-crop species, to uncover
   genes important to the evolution of seeds, an important agronomic
   trait. This project is being conducted with our partners in the NY
   Plant Genomic Consortium that include coPIs from NYU Biology (Coruzzi),
   NYU Courant (Shasha), NYBG (Stevenson), AMNH (DeSalle) and CSHL
   (McCombie & Martienssen).   Our approach is to generate and mine EST
   data from the the most primitive living-seed plants, the nodal
   Gymnosperms and the heterosporous lycophyte, Selaginella (as an
   outgroup), to resolve their phylogenetic relationship and to uncover
   novel genes and characters associated with the evolution and
   development of seeds. This project is being conducted collaboratively
   by scientists at three NY area institutions specializing in evolution,
   genomics and bioinformatics, who comprise The New York Plant Genomics
   Consortium (www.nypgenomics.org).  Participants in this project include
   PIs who collaborate in the training of post docs and graduate students
   from New York University, The New York Botanical Garden, Cold Spring
   Harbor, and The American Museum of Natural History.  We aim to achieve
   three goals:

   Research

   My research interests focus on gap junctions which are involved in
   cell-to-cell communication. Regulating the chemical and physical
   properties of gap junctions are the different connexin proteins. Unique
   communication compartments can be formed when gap junctions are
   assembled from various connexins.

   Presently, I am examining the implications of gap junctions on cell
   differentiation and development using the testis as a model. Organized
   in the seminiferous tubule and supported by Sertoli cells are some 63
   different germ cell types. The germ cells are arranged and organized in
   the seminiferous epithelium for an ordered development and
   differentiation into spermatozoa. We are currently determining gap
   junction‚s role in the formation of specific communication compartments
   and how gap junctions regulate and support specific spermatogenic
   cells. Gap junction assembly, connexin composition, and the chemical
   and physical properties of homotypic - heterotypic gap junctions will
   be examined biochemically and ultrastructurally.

   In the Carlton lab, we use the tools of comparative genomics ‚ whole
   genome sequencing and genomics, bioinformatics, molecular biology and
   population genetics ‚ to study the biology and evolution of closely
   related strains or species of parasite. In medicine and global public
   health, the term parasite is used to describe a group of eukaryotic
   microbes and helminths that cause some of the world‚s most devastating
   diseases. The parasites that we study include:

   (1) Species of the malaria parasite Plasmodium: more than half the
   world‚s population is at risk from malaria, and the disease causes ~216
   million cases and ~655,000 deaths per year. The most deadly form of the
   parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is found mostly in sub-Saharan Africa
   where it causes the deaths of children < 5 years old. Plasmodium vivax
   is the most common species outside Africa in South America and
   Southeast Asia, and is closely related to a group of species that
   infect Asian Old World monkeys from Taiwan to Sri Lanka, called the
   monkey malaria clade.

   Map of malaria distribution. Picture Credit: World Malaria Report 2005

   (2) The sexually transmitted parasite Trichomonas vaginalis and related
   trichomonads: T. vaginalis is the most common non-viral STI, and causes
   ~249 million cases per year world-wide. It is associated with increased
   risk of HIV-1 infection, and serious complications during pregnancy.
   Other trichomonads include Trichomonas tenax found in the mouth,
   Pentatrichomonas hominis a zoonotic gut parasite, and Tritrichomonas
   foetus a serious venereal pathogen that causes abortion in cattle.

   (3) Other fascinating parasites such as species of the enteric pathogen
   Cryptosporidium, the bovine parasite Theileria, and Babesia.

   Our research often begins with generation of a resource such as
   sequencing, assembly and annotation of a parasite‚s genome. For
   example, we have been involved in the sequencing of P. falciparum [1],
   species of rodent malaria (Plasmodium yoelii yoelii [2], Plasmodium
   chabaudi chabaudi and Plasmodium berghei [3]), several strains of P.
   vivax [4, 5], several strains of the monkey malaria Plasmodium
   cynomolgi [6], and the first T. vaginalis genome [7].

   Sequencing the genome of a parasite enables the complete gene and
   protein repertoire to be identified and provides a wealth of data about
   the basic biology of that organism, leading to hypothesis-driven
   studies. Generating sequences of multiple strains or species enables
   studies of whole genome evolution, genetic diversity and population
   genetics/genomics. Some of the research areas that members of the
   Carlton lab undertake in these areas include:

   Since many of the parasites we work on are important global public
   health problems in lower and middle income countries as well as poor
   regions of the United States, we collaborate with researchers and
   clinicians who work in public health clinics in order to move our
   research from the bench to the field. Some examples of our
   collaborations include:

   Behavioral genetics / Neurobiology / Circadian rhythms

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   How genes control animal behavior is the big question my lab is
   interested in. We mainly study circadian (~24hr) rhythms of behavior,
   arguably the best understood behavior at molecular and cellular levels.
   We use the fruitfly Drosophila as a powerful model system that has led
   the way in circadian rhythm research and is ideal for analyzing
   behavior at the level of single genes, single neurons, neuronal
   networks and whole animal behavior. We use Genetics, Genomics &
   BioInformatics, Microscopy and Behavioral assays to build a holistic
   model of how flies anticipate daily environmental changes.

   Adult flies have 24hr rhythms in their activity: they are more active
   by day, especially at dusk and dawn, and rest by night ‚ paralleling
   human sleep/wake cycles. These rhythms persist in constant darkness,
   indicating that flies have an internal sense of time. Forward genetics
   helped identify a set of core clock genes that are essential for 24hr
   rhythms in constant darkness, and these genes work together in
   transcription / translation feedback loops, forming "molecular clocks".

   A recent technical breakthrough we made has allowed us to obtain whole
   different times of day. These datasets are helping us understand the
   biology of these neurons by giving us insights into how LNvs control
   the timing of their output signals, novel signaling pathways involved
   in circadian rhythms and a system-level understanding of how LNv gene
   expression is altered in different electrical states.

   The larval clock neurons form a ‚minimal‚ circadian neural network with
   many fewer neurons than adult flies. We have been using this simplified
   circadian system to understand how clock neurons communicate to keep
   their molecular clocks synchronized with each other and to generate
   rhythmic behavior. The expectation is that what we learn in Drosophila
   will hold true for mammalian pacemaker neurons. Other projects ongoing
   in the lab include developing a novel decision-making paradigm in
   Drosophila.

   Developmental and evolutionary genomics of plants. The origin and
   genetic programming of cell types.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   The research in my lab focuses on two inter-related questions: How do
   multi-cellular organisms construct specialized cells and how do the
   genetic components of specialized cells change over evolutionary
   scales? The goal is to better understand how gene regulatory networks
   orchestrate cell maturation, a process that results in a set of highly
   specialized cell types. Thus, we focus on cellular differentiation,
   which is one of the key steps in organ formation and development in
   higher organisms. The approach of the lab combines genomics and
   molecular genetic tools. For example, we have pioneered a new technique
   to isolate cell types in plants using high-speed fluidics. From there,
   RNA from a specific cell type population is applied to microarrays to
   cell-specific regulators and infer properties of the genetic circuitry
   of cellular specification.

   Two experimental approaches are being used to address this larger
   question. The first project is large-scale reverse genetics guided by a
   detailed map of gene expression in the root and other organs. As a case
   study in cellular development, we have started to analyze knockouts of
   genes that are highly enriched in xylem, which are the water-conducting
   cells of the plant's vascular system. We also use computational
   approaches to generate testable hypotheses on the targets of
   transcription factors that control xylem maturation. The second project
   is creating detailed maps of gene expression in the roots of other
   plant species, such as rice. This will help us to track changes in gene
   expression during evolution. We can then ask how genetic networks have
   changed over time to create new cellular attributes and, occasionally,
   new cell types.

   Developmental systems biology.

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   Our laboratory is interested in the integrative analysis of diverse
   functional genomics data to identify groups of genes that work in
   specific cellular and developmental processes. A major challenge in
   systems biology is how to extract meaningful biological insights from
   large heterogeneous data sets that probe different aspects of gene
   function. Several ongoing projects in the lab use integrative
   approaches to analyze and interpret large-scale datasets and to
   generate testable hypotheses on gene function in different biological
   systems. These projects all involve close collaborative interaction
   between experimental and computational scientists.

   Molecular networks in C. elegans early embryogenesis
   We have used an integrative approach to characterize gene networks that
   function in the very early C. elegans embryo, based on data from
   different kinds of functional genomics data that we and others have
   collected, such as protein-protein interactions, gene expression
   work in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Fabio Piano to
   systematically define genetic interactions in C. elegans early
   embryogenesis. Genetic interactions tell us about logical relationships
   between different cellular components, and we are analyzing how these
   functional dependencies complement other functional data that we
   already have in hand. The long-term goal of this work is to develop a
   global map of the molecular architecture underlying early development
   in C. elegans.

   the network is filtered for high-confidence functional links between

   organization of molecular machinery is revealed, in which groups of
   highly interconnected genes are linked to each other via a small number
   of functional interactions. Adapted from Gunsalus et al., Nature 2005.

   Genetic requirements for mouse early embryogenesis
   We are collaborating with Dr. Nicole Noyes of the NYU School of
   Medicine to predict and analyze RNAi phenotypes in early mouse embryos
   using time-lapse microscopy. For this work, we are leveraging
   functional genomic data from several model organisms to identify
   candidate genes for RNAi that will help us define the spectrum of
   phenotypic defects that can occur in early mammalian embryos, similar
   to our previous work in C. elegans. One of the goals of this
   translational project is to develop a more sophisticated and
   non-invasive way to determine the developmental potential of human
   embryos for patients who seek reproductive assistance for infertility.

   Post-transcriptional gene regulation in C. elegans
   Regulation of mRNA localization, translation, and stability is
   increasingly recognized as in important layer in the regulation of gene
   activity in diverse biological systems. The modENCODE Consortium is an
   NIH/NHGRI initiative to identify and analyze functional elements in
   model organism genomes. As part of modENCODE, we are involved in the
   annotation of C. elegans 3‚UTRs and functional sequence elements
   contained in these regions. The goal of this work is to identify and
   test putative post-transcriptional regulatory networks in development.
   This project is a collaboration with Fabio Piano (PI), John Kim (U.
   Michigan, Co-PI), and Nikolaus Rajewsky (Center for Medical Systems
   Biology, Max Delbruck Center, Berlin, Co-PI).

   Interactive tools for functional genomic data
   As part of these projects, we develop web-based tools and graphical
   interfaces to provide the research community at large with enhanced
   access to and mining capabilities for large-scale functional genomic
   data. To facilitate a systems-level view of gene networks, we have
   developed a web-based network visualization tool called "N-Browse"
   neighborhoods and heterogeneous functional relationships in a modular
   way based on these integrated data. We have also developed a
   web-accessible database of RNA interference (RNAi) phenotypes in C.
   distribute data from large-scale RNAi studies and as an online notebook
   for ongoing high-content phenotypic analysis. In conjunction, we are
   developing strategies to make phenotypic data more amenable to
   computational analysis and tools to mine these data.

   Research

   The aim of our research is to understand phenotypic evolution by
   studying the processes by which the genetic networks underlying
   development diverge. A major feature of developmental networks is their
   robustness (Masel & Siegal 2009). That is, they are tolerant of both
   environmental and genetic perturbations. Our lab uses both experimental
   and computational approaches to understand the causes and evolutionary
   consequences of this robustness.

   One major experimental focus in our lab is on the process of sexual
   differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster and related flies. Sexual
   differentiation is a powerful model system for studying the evolution
   of development because many aspects of sexual morphology, physiology
   and behavior differ between closely related species, thereby enabling
   high-resolution comparative analysis. Despite this rapid divergence,
   sexual traits are highly robust within species and indeed are often
   diagnostic of species. We are using genomic and genetic approaches to
   identify and characterize regulatory pathways involved in genital
   development and function in D. melanogaster (e.g., Chatterjee et al.
   2011). This will lay the groundwork for determining how these robust
   pathways diverged between closely related species.

   A second major experimental focus is on directly identifying and
   characterizing genes that contribute to robustness of many traits. We
   have screened the genome of the laboratory yeast, Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, for genes whose deletion increases the variation in the
   morphologies of individual, genetically identical cells. Yeast is
   advantageous for this work because of its wealth of genetic and genomic
   resources, and because it lends itself to high-throughput analyses.
   Hundreds of yeast genes increase morphological variation when deleted,
   and these genes tend to be highly connected in cellular networks (Levy
   & Siegal 2008). We are currently testing whether the same genes also
   buffer genetic differences between cells, and whether the variation
   that is revealed by impairment of these genes is potentially
   beneficial. This work is complemented by theoretical investigations
   into the evolution of complex gene networks (e.g., Bergman & Siegal
   regulatory networks (e.g., Chen et al. 2010), which give us predictions
   to test experimentally.

   The use of GIS, remote sensing and modeling to explore spatial and
   temporal variability in ecosystems

   Research

   My current research is focused on the spatial dynamics of Lyme disease
   and other tick-borne pathogens in two different ecosystems.

   Spatial dynamics of ticks and tick-borne diseases in Dutchess County,
   NY
   In Dutchess County, an area where Lyme disease is endemic, we are
   interested in the spatial distribution of the black-legged tick, Ixodes
   scapularis, and potential environmental correlates. Additionally, we
   are studying the effects of host communities on Lyme disease and
   Anaplasmosis.

   Sudden Oak Death and Lyme disease in northern California
   Forest communities in northern California are being altered by Sudden
   Oak Death. The change in forest species composition and the creation of
   canopy gaps may affect the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus,
   and their hosts. We are studying how tick and host populations are
   influenced by Sudden Oak Death and the resulting affects on Lyme
   disease risk.

   Evolutionary and molecular causes of heritable variation in animals

   List of Publications from Pubmed

   List of citations from Google Scholar

   Our goal is to understand the relationship between the molecular
   mechanisms that shape phenotypes within individuals and the
   evolutionary mechanisms that generate and maintain phenotypic variation
   within populations. This project requires that we identify the
   functional allelic variants that segregate in nature, understand their
   molecular mechanisms, characterize their population genetic dynamics,
   and build models that explain these dynamics in terms of molecular
   biology and ecology.

   We use molecular and quantitative genetics to discover the alleles that
   underlie phenotypic variation. Our primary model system is C. elegans,
   a bacteria-eating nematode widely distributed across the globe. Natural
   isolates of this species harbor variation for development, morphology,
   behavior, and physiology (indeed, for almost any trait we can measure).
   A particular focus of our research is the genetic basis of gene
   gene activity underlies development, genetic analysis of gene
   expression variation provides a unique window into the substrate
