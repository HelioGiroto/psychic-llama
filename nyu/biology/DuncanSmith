   As a consequence of the antiparallel arrangement of the two strands of
   the DNA double helix and the 5'-3' polarity of DNA polymerases, DNA
   replication is intrinsically asymmetric. Only one parental strand at
   the replication fork can be continuously replicated: the other -- the
   lagging strand -- is discontinuously synthesized via the iterative
   generation, processing and ligation of Okazaki fragments to generate an
   intact daughter strand.

   Figure 1

   Lagging-strand synthesis requires a coordinated sequence of several
   enzymatic activities (Fig. 1). Each Okazaki fragment is (i) initiated
   by Pola/primase and (ii) subsequently extended by DNA polymerase d
   (Pold); the 5' end of the preceding fragment is (iii) displaced by
   ongoing Pold synthesis and degraded by one of several nucleases;
   finally, (iv) DNA ligase joins the fragment to the nascent daughter
   strand. My lab is interested in several broad questions related to the
   regulation and coordination of lagging-strand synthesis, which we
   investigate using a combined genetic, biochemical and genomic approach
   in the model yeast S. cerevisiae.

   I graduated from Cambridge University in 2004 with a B.A. in Natural
   Sciences, and immediately moved to New York to pursue a Ph.D. at The
   Rockefeller University. At Rockefeller I worked with Magda Konarska,
   investigating the determinants of substrate specificity during pre-mRNA
   splicing while maintaining a side-interest in the intrinsic catalytic
   potential of RNA. In 2009 I moved across York Avenue to join Iestyn
   Whitehouse's lab at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; with
   Iestyn, I developed genomics techniques to study lagging-strand
   synthesis in vivo in budding yeast. I started my lab at NYU in
   September 2013.
