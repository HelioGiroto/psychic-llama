   Assistant Professor of Biology

   Affiliation: NYU Abu Dhabi

   B.Sc. in Biology from Ibn Zohr in Agadir; M.Sc., University of
   Leicester; Ph.D., North Carolina State University

   Youssef Idaghdour study how genome and environment interact. In
   particular, he is interested in characterizing genetic and
   gene-environment interactions and how they transduce into the
   phenotypic level moving from the architecture of the genome itself to
   protein function and transitioning through the complex modes of gene
   expression regulation. His laboratory uses statistical genetic methods
   and multiple types of high-throughput genomic data including genome
   sequencing, epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling, proteomics and
   metabolomics to study these interactions in the human circulating
   immune system. The goal is to gain basic biological insight about the
   perturbations of molecular networks taking place during the onset of
   disease and under certain pathologic contexts including metabolic
   syndrome and infection.

   Youssef grew up in southern Morocco where he later graduated with BSc
   in Biology and spent several years working on endangered avian species.
   After completing his M.Sc. training in Molecular Genetics at the
   University of Leicester in the UK and Ph.D. training in Genetics at
   North Carolina State University under a Fulbright Scholarship, he
   received a Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship and became part of a large
   program in medical and population genomics at Sainte-Justine Research
   Center in Montreal prior to joining New York University Abu Dhabi.
