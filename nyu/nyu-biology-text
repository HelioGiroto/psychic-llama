Transcriptional activation of the early Drosophila genome

embryo relies on maternally deposited gene products to begin
represents a major cellular reprogramming event whereby thousands of
maternal RNAs are degraded and hundreds of new zygotic RNAs are
transcribed during the time between egg fertilization and blastoderm
goal is to understand how Zelda mediates the rapid and robust
activation of the zygotic genome and how it works together with the
other key transcription factors to prepare the embryo for major
developmental processes such as gastrulation and tissue

we are examining the chromatin landscape in wild type and zelda mutant
embryos to determine how Zelda cooperates with other key regulators
A second Zelda project stems from the observation that Zelda is
Zelda is expressed in the undifferentiated cells and is down-regulated
The projects in the my lab require the use of several types of
approaches from manipulating genes and transgenes and observing the
how global factors like Zelda interact with key regulators to control
