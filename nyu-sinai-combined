   we are interested in unusual mechanisms involved in regulating gene
   expression. recently, we have been developing approaches to studying
   epigenetic regulation at the scale of the entire human genome.
   elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms is essential to normal development
   and disease. some of our recent discoveries may help in elucidating
   complex heritable disorders.
   are there yet uncovered mechanisms impacting gene regulation which can
   be discovered through genome-scale approaches?
   what gives individual cells their identities?
   how unique are individual cells?
   these questions (and others) have been approached in studies of various
   species including humans, mice and the fruit fly, drosophila

   this website was built using bootstrap, from twitter.
   research in the baxter lab focuses on the neural mechanisms of
   learning, memory, executive function, and decision-making, and the ways
   in which these mechanisms fail in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders.
   our research interests are broad and include the functional
   neuroanatomy of frontal and temporal cortex, regulation of higher
   cognitive functions by neuromodulators, the biological basis of
   cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative disease and neuropsychiatric
   conditions, as well as the neurobiological and cognitive effects of
   general anesthesia. our approach to answering questions about the
   relationship between brain systems and cognition is to interfere with
   the function of defined neural systems in experimental animal models,
   and determine the consequences of this interference on behavior.
   a striking feature of the mature central nervous system is the
   precision of its synaptic circuitry. more than 20 billion neurons in
   the human brain are precisely connected with one another through
   trillions of synapses. much of the wiring is established in the absence
   of neural activity or experience indicating the basic organization of
   neural pathways is encoded in the genetic program. recent studies
   support that several devastating developmental diseases, including
   autism and schizophrenia, have as their root cause modifications in the
   genetic program that ultimately disrupt the balance of synaptic
   connections. in order to understand how synapse specificity is achieved
   and how it is altered in human diseases, we investigate mechanisms
   controlling pathway development and synaptogenesis in development and
   how these same mechanisms influence synapse stability and plasticity in
   adulthood.
   our mission is to integrate state-of-the-art technologies, animal
   models and drug discovery to promote a center of excellence for myelin
   repair.
   the overall goal is to move towards personalized regenerative medicine
   and design of new therapeutic strategies to repair the damage and
   restore function.
   research overview:
   our ability to move, think, perceive, is dependent on a timely
   transmission of information among specialized cells called neurons.
   this information is sent via a series of electrical impulses that
   travel along specialized structures called "axons", whose ability to
   conduct signal is dependent on the presence of "myelin".
   myelin is a fatty substance composed of lipids and proteins that is an
   integral component of a cell called "oligodendrocyte".
   oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the cns and are
   essential for brain function.
   oligodendrocytes originate from neural stem cells that undergo several
   changes before reaching the stage of late maturation.
   the laboratory is working in major research areas:
   i am interested in translational research in regenerative and
   personalized medicine. with the help of my team we made several
   contributions to elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for
   oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation during
   development.

   emotional experiences leave an enduring record in the brain by way of
   structural and molecular remodeling of cells and synapses.  while these
   modifications help organisms respond appropriately to threats and
   rewards, they also contribute to maladaptive states like addiction and
   post-traumatic stress disorder.  many key characteristics of emotional
   memory mirror those of synaptic plasticity in reduced neuronal
   preparations.  for example, both involve changes in neurotransmission
   that can persist for long periods provided they undergo molecular
   stabilization.  we now recognize, however, that this basic model fails
   to capture the complexity of processes that contribute to emotional
   memory storage, or that update or inhibit memory as behavioral
   conditions change.
   we utilize molecular and electrophysiological approaches, including
   optogenetic stimulation, to identify how associative fear conditioning
   modifies neural pathways and individual neurons in limbic and cortical
   brain regions.  once fear responses are established, other experiments
   address the mechanisms that contribute to their long-term maintenance,
   as well as their reinforcement or attenuation by molecular and
   behavioral interventions.
   work in my lab is focused on how experience alters the function of
   brain circuits to encode emotional responses.

   we are interested in unusual mechanisms involved in regulating gene
   expression. recently, we have been developing approaches to studying
   epigenetic regulation at the scale of the entire human genome.
   elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms is essential to normal development
   and disease. some of our recent discoveries may help in elucidating
   complex heritable disorders.
   are there yet uncovered mechanisms impacting gene regulation which can
   be discovered through genome-scale approaches?
   what gives individual cells their identities?
   how unique are individual cells?
   these questions (and others) have been approached in studies of various
   species including humans, mice and the fruit fly, drosophila
   melanogaster.
   more information will be available on this site soon..... in the
   meantime, some further descriptions can be found ....here.
   andrew chess is at mount sinai school of medicine in the department of

   the goal of our research is to explore the organization and packaging
   of the genome (which is comprised of 6 billion basepairs) inside the
   nuclei of human brain cells, including potential alterations in
   psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, depression and autism. we
   study histone modifications and variants, chromosomal loopings and
   other building blocks of the epigenome in human brain tissue collected
   postmortem across the lifespan. this descriptive work is complemented
   by a discovery-based approach in genetically engineered mice and cell
   culture systems, aimed at novel chromatin-associated mechanisms
   governing the brain's cognitive and affective states.
   research projects and experimental approaches
   we explore epigenetic regulation of gene expression, in order to
   identify epigenetic drug targets and novel treatment avenues for
   psychosis, depression and other psychiatric disease.

   this website was built using bootstrap, from twitter.
   research in the baxter lab focuses on the neural mechanisms of
   learning, memory, executive function, and decision-making, and the ways
   in which these mechanisms fail in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders.
   our research interests are broad and include the functional
   neuroanatomy of frontal and temporal cortex, regulation of higher
   cognitive functions by neuromodulators, the biological basis of
   cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative disease and neuropsychiatric
   conditions, as well as the neurobiological and cognitive effects of
   general anesthesia. our approach to answering questions about the
   relationship between brain systems and cognition is to interfere with
   the function of defined neural systems in experimental animal models,
   and determine the consequences of this interference on behavior.
   a striking feature of the mature central nervous system is the
   precision of its synaptic circuitry. more than 20 billion neurons in
   the human brain are precisely connected with one another through
   trillions of synapses. much of the wiring is established in the absence
   of neural activity or experience indicating the basic organization of
   neural pathways is encoded in the genetic program. recent studies
   support that several devastating developmental diseases, including
   autism and schizophrenia, have as their root cause modifications in the
   genetic program that ultimately disrupt the balance of synaptic
   connections. in order to understand how synapse specificity is achieved
   and how it is altered in human diseases, we investigate mechanisms
   controlling pathway development and synaptogenesis in development and
   how these same mechanisms influence synapse stability and plasticity in
   adulthood.
   our mission is to integrate state-of-the-art technologies, animal
   models and drug discovery to promote a center of excellence for myelin
   repair.
   the overall goal is to move towards personalized regenerative medicine
   and design of new therapeutic strategies to repair the damage and
   restore function.
   research overview:
   our ability to move, think, perceive, is dependent on a timely
   transmission of information among specialized cells called neurons.
   this information is sent via a series of electrical impulses that
   travel along specialized structures called "axons", whose ability to
   conduct signal is dependent on the presence of "myelin".
   myelin is a fatty substance composed of lipids and proteins that is an
   integral component of a cell called "oligodendrocyte".
   oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the cns and are
   essential for brain function.
   oligodendrocytes originate from neural stem cells that undergo several
   changes before reaching the stage of late maturation.
   the laboratory is working in major research areas:
   i am interested in translational research in regenerative and
   personalized medicine. with the help of my team we made several
   contributions to elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for
   oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation during
   development.

   we are interested in unusual mechanisms involved in regulating gene
   expression. recently, we have been developing approaches to studying
   epigenetic regulation at the scale of the entire human genome.
   elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms is essential to normal development
   and disease. some of our recent discoveries may help in elucidating
   complex heritable disorders.
   are there yet uncovered mechanisms impacting gene regulation which can
   be discovered through genome-scale approaches?
   what gives individual cells their identities?
   how unique are individual cells?
   these questions (and others) have been approached in studies of various
   species including humans, mice and the fruit fly, drosophila
   melanogaster.
   more information will be available on this site soon..... in the
   meantime, some further descriptions can be found ....here.
   andrew chess is at mount sinai school of medicine in the department of
   developmental and regenerative biology, the department of neuroscience,
   and the department of genetics and genomic sciences. we are also part
   of the friedman brain insitute. the lab is located on the 25th floor of

   the goal of our research is to explore the organization and packaging
   of the genome (which is comprised of 6 billion basepairs) inside the
   nuclei of human brain cells, including potential alterations in
   psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, depression and autism. we
   study histone modifications and variants, chromosomal loopings and
   other building blocks of the epigenome in human brain tissue collected
   postmortem across the lifespan. this descriptive work is complemented
   by a discovery-based approach in genetically engineered mice and cell
   culture systems, aimed at novel chromatin-associated mechanisms
   governing the brain's cognitive and affective states.
   research projects and experimental approaches
   we explore epigenetic regulation of gene expression, in order to
   identify epigenetic drug targets and novel treatment avenues for
   psychosis, depression and other psychiatric disease.

   this website was built using bootstrap, from twitter.
   research in the baxter lab focuses on the neural mechanisms of
   learning, memory, executive function, and decision-making, and the ways
   in which these mechanisms fail in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders.
   our research interests are broad and include the functional
   neuroanatomy of frontal and temporal cortex, regulation of higher
   cognitive functions by neuromodulators, the biological basis of
   cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative disease and neuropsychiatric
   conditions, as well as the neurobiological and cognitive effects of
   general anesthesia. our approach to answering questions about the
   relationship between brain systems and cognition is to interfere with
   the function of defined neural systems in experimental animal models,
   and determine the consequences of this interference on behavior.
   a striking feature of the mature central nervous system is the
   precision of its synaptic circuitry. more than 20 billion neurons in
   the human brain are precisely connected with one another through
   trillions of synapses. much of the wiring is established in the absence
   of neural activity or experience indicating the basic organization of
   neural pathways is encoded in the genetic program. recent studies
   support that several devastating developmental diseases, including
   autism and schizophrenia, have as their root cause modifications in the
   genetic program that ultimately disrupt the balance of synaptic
   connections. in order to understand how synapse specificity is achieved
   and how it is altered in human diseases, we investigate mechanisms
   controlling pathway development and synaptogenesis in development and
   how these same mechanisms influence synapse stability and plasticity in
   adulthood.
   our mission is to integrate state-of-the-art technologies, animal
   models and drug discovery to promote a center of excellence for myelin
   repair.
   the overall goal is to move towards personalized regenerative medicine
   and design of new therapeutic strategies to repair the damage and
   restore function.
   research overview:
   our ability to move, think, perceive, is dependent on a timely
   transmission of information among specialized cells called neurons.
   this information is sent via a series of electrical impulses that
   travel along specialized structures called "axons", whose ability to
   conduct signal is dependent on the presence of "myelin".
   myelin is a fatty substance composed of lipids and proteins that is an
   integral component of a cell called "oligodendrocyte".
   oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the cns and are
   essential for brain function.
   oligodendrocytes originate from neural stem cells that undergo several
   changes before reaching the stage of late maturation.
   the laboratory is working in major research areas:
   i am interested in translational research in regenerative and
   personalized medicine. with the help of my team we made several
   contributions to elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for
   oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation during
   development.

   emotional experiences leave an enduring record in the brain by way of
   structural and molecular remodeling of cells and synapses.  while these
   modifications help organisms respond appropriately to threats and
   rewards, they also contribute to maladaptive states like addiction and
   post-traumatic stress disorder.  many key characteristics of emotional
   memory mirror those of synaptic plasticity in reduced neuronal
   preparations.  for example, both involve changes in neurotransmission
   that can persist for long periods provided they undergo molecular
   stabilization.  we now recognize, however, that this basic model fails
   to capture the complexity of processes that contribute to emotional
   memory storage, or that update or inhibit memory as behavioral
   conditions change.
   we utilize molecular and electrophysiological approaches, including
   optogenetic stimulation, to identify how associative fear conditioning
   modifies neural pathways and individual neurons in limbic and cortical
   brain regions.  once fear responses are established, other experiments
   address the mechanisms that contribute to their long-term maintenance,
   as well as their reinforcement or attenuation by molecular and
   behavioral interventions.
   work in my lab is focused on how experience alters the function of
   brain circuits to encode emotional responses.

   in parallel studies, we have recently discovered that the large family
   of potassium channel proteins, that include the g protein-sensitive
   channels, function by direct interactions with phosphatidylinositol
   phospholipids in the plasma membrane. g protein signaling is likely to
   activate these channels conformationally by adjusting channel
   phospholipid interactions. moreover, signaling pathways that regulate
   the level of these phospholipids critically affect the function of
   these potassium channels. \r\n\r\n\r\n
   cardiac and neuronal cells of the central nervous system, where these
   channels are prevalent, are isolated from heart and brain and are
   studied electrophysiologically. transgenic models with defects in g
   proteins or the potassium channel are used to elucidate the functional
   importance of these molecules in the particular tissue and the whole
   organism. \r\n\r\n\r\n
   the lab employs electrophysiological techniques to assay ion channel
   function (patch clamp, two-electrode voltage clamp). molecular
   biological techniques are used to clone and perform structure-function
   studies on these potassium channels. expression of recombinant channels
   in xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines are used routinely towards
   mechanistic studies. cell isolation methods and tissue culture
   techniques are also routinely used. confocal microscopy is used to
   localize the channel proteins in cells and tissues. \r\n\r\n

   dr. e. premkumar reddy obtained his ph.d. in 1971 and carried out his
   post-doctoral training at the ucla school of medicine from 1972-1974
   and later at the national cancer institute from 1974-75.   he worked at
   the national cancer institute first as an independent investigator and
   later as a section chief between 1975 and 1984.  in 1984, he moved to
   hoffmann la roche and held appointments at hoffmann la roche and the
   roche institute of molecular biology as a full member.  in 1986, he
   joined the wistar institute as a professor and deputy director.  from
   1992 to 2010, he served as the director of the fels institute for
   cancer research and molecular biology, temple university school of
   medicine, philadelphia. he joined the mount sinai school of medicine in
   march of 2010 as a professor in the departments of oncological sciences
   and the department of structural and chemical biology and as the
   director of experimental cancer therapeutics.
   while working at the national cancer institute, he made a number of
   seminal discoveries that provided a clear understanding of the
   molecular basis of cancer.  he cloned and sequenced a number of viral
   oncogenes which included abl, ras, fgr, mos, myb, myc and sis oncogenes
   and their cellular homologues which pinpointed the precise changes that
   cellular proto-oncogenes undergo to produce cancer-causing viral
   oncogenes.   he extended this work to human cancers and was responsible
   for the seminal discovery that point mutations in the cellular ras
   genes result in their oncogenic activation.  his work also showed the
   mechanisms associated with the activation of abl and myb oncogenes,
   which are associated with the development of human myelogenous
   leukemias. his recent work on cell cycle regulator, cdk4 has shown that
   this gene is very critical for the development of erbb2 and ras
   oncogene-induced tumors and inhibition of expression of cdk4 causes
   ablation of breast cancers caused by erbb2 and ras oncogenes.
   dr. reddy has pioneered the development of small molecule inhibitors
   targeted against oncogenes and cell cycle regulators for cancer
   therapy.  one of the drugs developed by dr. reddy, on01910 is currently
   in phase iii clinical trials and has shown profound clinical activity
   in mds (myelodysplastic syndrome) patients as a single agent.  in
   combination with oxaliplatin and gemcitabine, on01910 was found to have
   remarkable efficacy in reducing the tumor burden of several metastatic
   cancers including breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers.   in addition
   to on01910, dr. reddy has developed six different cancer drugs, two of
   which (on013100, and on01210) have entered clinical trials and the
   other three are expected to enter clinical trials in the next one
   year.  two of these drugs, a small molecule inhibitor of plk2,
   on1231320 and a second compounds on123300 which is a dual inhibitor of
   cdk4 and akt pathways are currently undergoing pre-clinical evaluation.
   dr. reddy  founded the cancer journal oncogene in 1986 and served as
   its editor from 1986 to 2009.  in 2010, he founded a second cancer
   journal, genes & cancer for which he currently serves as the
   editor-in-chief.

   my research interests are at the interface of chemistry and biology.
   specifically my lab develops and uses optical probes, called "caged
   compounds", to understand fundamental principles in cellular
   physiology. i have worked in this field since my post-doctoral studies
   at the university of pennsylvania in the late 1980s. during that time i
   published two seminal papers developing the most widely used caged
   calcium probes (pnas 1988, 1994). these light-sensitive reagents have
   been the basis of 100s of biological studies in many disciples. since
   1995 i have had an independent lab that has been continuously funded by
   the us national institutes of health. during this period the focus of
   my research has been developing and using tools for two-photon
   microscopy. in 2001 we published a seminal paper in this field, which
   was the first example of optical stimulation of visually designated
   single synapses (nature neuroscience). this work proved the foundation
   for work by many neuroscience labs around the world. my recent research
   at mount sinai has involved developing new probes that allow
   chromatically selective, multi-color uncaging. with this work we have
   taken optical stimulation of cells out of the "monochrome era" so as to
   enable bi-directional control of neuronal signaling with different
   colors of light for the first time.
   in the past 30 years the use of fluorescence imaging in biological
   sciences has been as important as dna-based methods advancing our
   understanding in almost every field. (nobel prizes for gfp (2008) and
   super resolution imaging (2014) are testament to this.) my work during
   this period has pioneered the use of light to control cell function,
   the optical tools we have made have proved to be conceptual fundamental
   enabling technologies. the goal of my current and future work is to be
   equally transformative.
   my lab uses organic chemistry to develop new optical methods for cell
   physiology.

   model of the bulky analog n6-(benzyl)-adp docked in the expanded active
   site of analog-sensitive (as) mutant human cdk2
   a network in control of cell division and gene expression
   how do cells decide when to divide and, having committed to that fate,
   how do they faithfully duplicate and segregate their contentsâincluding
   their dna? among the progeny of these divisions, which all carry the
   same genetic information, how are different programs of gene expression
   established and maintained? our lab studies the regulation of both
   processesâcell division and gene expressionâby a network of
   cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). we take a chemical genetic approach,
   by expanding the atp-binding pocket of a targeted cdk to accommodate
   bulky atp analogsâboth inhibitors and substratesâthat cannot bind to
   the wild-type kinase (figure). in multicellular organisms, cell-cycle
   and transcriptional cdk networks are linked by cdk7, the cdk-activating
   kinase (cak), which is also part of the general transcription factor
   tfiih. we determined how cdk7 coordinates its cell-cycle function with
   a second essential function during the transcription cycle of rna
   polymerase (rnap) ii. our studies reveal similarities of organization
   cycles, in which checkpoints and surveillance systems enforce fidelity,
   directionality and irreversibility. by chemical genetic analysis of the
   cdk network we hope to define the precise roles and targets of specific
   cdk-cyclin complexes in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulation, and
   to identify potential vulnerabilities of cancer cells to specific cdk
   inhibitors.

   our research is directed towards the study of selective neuronal
   vulnerability in dementing illnesses using classical neuropathological
   as well as modern quantitative immunohistochemical methods. we intend
   to develop a quantitative, detailed and cohesive definition of neuronal
   susceptibility to degeneration in the cerebral cortex, by extending
   data on alzheimer disease to other dementing disorders as well as
   animal models of age-related illnesses, and by defining the key
   neurochemical and morphological characteristics linked to relative
   vulnerability (or resistance to degeneration) of identified neuronal
   populations. the regional and laminar distribution in the cerebral
   cortex of specific neuronal populations is investigated in a variety of
   neurodegenerative disorders, and quantitatively compared to alzheimer
   disease and control brains. in addition, a detailed study of brains
   from aged patients with no records of neurological and psychiatric
   disorders is performed in order to define further the limits of normal
   aging in the brain.
   we employ advanced microscopy, high field magnetic resonance imaging,
   stereologic, and modeling approaches to develop an accurate
   quantitative assessment of such pathological changes in a region- and
   layer-specific manner. neuronal morphology is analyzed in a
   quantitative manner using intracellular injection of hippocampal and
   neocortical neurons coupled with computerized reconstruction to assess
   the degree to which the accumulation of pathologic markers causes
   dendritic atrophy and spine loss in different subtypes of neocortical
   pyramidal cells subserving cortical circuits critical for memory and
   cognition. the characterization of such vulnerable neurons and circuits
   is fundamental to the design of therapeutic strategies aiming at their
   protection or rescue. similar approaches are applied to the
   neuropathology of schizophrenia and autism.
   finally we are investigating mammalian brain evolution with a focus on
   cetaceans and great apes. these studies have led us to identify
   specific neuronal types in parts of the cerebral cortex known to be
   involved in social awareness, judgment, and attention that can be
   considered as markers of adaptive mechanisms and functions in response
   to particular ecological pressure.

   synapse structure and function is continuously modified during
   development and throughout life by experience, such as learning new
   skills or forming new memories. such synaptic plasticity is thus
   critical for normal brain function. synaptic plasticity can also become
   maladaptive under conditions of brain, spinal or peripheral nerve
   injury, leading to abnormal function or sensation. dr. huntley's
   research focuses on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity through which
   synaptic structure and function are modified by experience or injury.
   research projects include: 1) the role of the cadherin family of
   synaptic adhesion proteins in synapse and circuit development,
   3) molecules and mechanisms regulating aberrant corticostriatal circuit
   development and plasticity in autism and parkinson's disease models.

   the explosion of large-scale, high-throughput technologies in the
   biological sciences demands a comprehensive view of biological
   systems.   dr. zhu's research focuses on:
   1.     method development in integrating diverse high-throughput data
   into probabilistic causal network models.  there are multiple risk
   factors as well as their interactions contributing to complex human
   diseases, such genetic background, infection, environmental states,
   life-style choices, and etc.   it is critical to integrate all these
   factors into comprehensive disease networks which provide a context to
   understand mechanism of diseases and to study effects of genetic
   perturbations, drug perturbations, and their interactions.  dr. zhu's
   group has developed many methods for integrating genetic and genomic
   data into bayesian networks:
   2.     method development in comparing multiple networks.  there are
   multiple risk/perturbation factors driving a biological system from a
   healthy state to a disease state.  in response, there are hundreds to
   thousands genes changed at transcription or protein levels.  dr. zhu's
   works showed that instead of monitoring changes in a few genes, it is
   more robust to monitor changes of network states or structures when
   studying complex diseases:
   3.     method development in analyzing biological networks.  if
   comprehensive biological networks are available, how to convert network
   knowledge into actionable items?  for example in drug discovery and
   development, we investigated which nodes and node combinations in the
   networks can generate largest beneficial effects when perturbed.  in
   biomarker research, we examined which parts of networks can robustly
   connect to drug response, disease progression and survivals.

   we explore information processing in the nervous system, and use the
   visual system as a convenient model. we employ systems analysis,
   borrowed from communication engineering, as the conceptual and
   methodological framework. we use single and multi-neuron recordings and
   optical imaging of neuronal activity, and have developed sophisticated
   techniques for stimulation of the visual system, and for the analysis
   of neuronal responses to these stimuli. we also record simultaneously
   the input and output of neurons in the visual thalamic nucleus, the
   lateral geniculate nucleus (lgn), in order to learn how information
   transmission from the retina to the visual cortex through the lgn is
   controlled. applied mathematics and computers are used extensively for
   stimulation, analysis and modeling of the systems under study.
    currently we are investigating the properties of visual neurons in the
   retina, lgn and visual cortex of monkeys and cats, with an emphasis on
   the temporal, spatial and chromatic selectivities of these cells, and
   on the nature, source and function of the variability (noise) of
   neuronal responses. since perception and behavior involve the
   coordinated activity of many interacting neurons, we also use optical
   imaging to visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of activity in
   neuronal ensembles in the visual cortex. in addition, we are recording
   from groups of neurons in the lgn and visual cortex, and study their
   dynamical interractions and the information that these neuronal
   ensembles carry. the experimental approaches are augmented by
   computational modeling of lgn neurons and cortical circuits. the topics
   we are focused on currently include: the representation of color in the
   primate visual cortex, the transmission of information from retina to
   cortex via the lgn, and the role of the descending pathways in the
   brain.
    recently we have started to record from populations of neurons in the
   brains of mice, from regions involved in depression, drug addiction and
   post-traumatic-stress-disorder (ptsd). the recorded regions incluide
   the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (vta). we subject
   the recordings to various mathematical methods that quantify the
   population behavior, in order to determine whether pathological
   behavior is reflected in the network behavior.
   our research is supported by grants from the nih's eye institute,
   institute for general medical sciences, and the institute for
   mathematical & biological synthesis.
    our research focuses on the analysis of human genetic variation to
   address fundamental questions in biology, medicine and anthropology. we
   are interested in detecting patterns of demography in genomic data to
   inform our inference of human evolution and history, and result in
   better outcomes for medical genomics. we combine population genetics
   theory, complex disease mapping, statistical modeling and
   experimentation to gain a deeper understanding of the landscape of
   genetic variation in global populations and its impact on function,
   fitness and adaptation. a detailed description of current projects can
   be found here.

   research focus
   epigenetic regulation in stem cells and human diseases.
   â â â  our research is focused on genomic imprinting. we are analyzing
   the acquisition and maintenance of genomic dna methylation imprints in
   mouse as well as in es and ips cells. we are also applying our zfp57
   knockout mouse to modeling of imprinting related complex human diseases
   such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
   genomic imprinting in stem cells
   â â â  genomic imprinting is essential for mammalian development.
   consistent with this, a majority of cloned embryos die in utero, mainly
   from the failure to re-establish proper genomic imprints. cell-based
   therapies offer great hopes for various degenerative diseases,
   including alzheimerâs disease and diabetes. embryonic stem (es) cells
   derived from nuclear transfer experiments and induced pluripotent stem
   (ips) cells reprogrammed from adult cells are candidates for this
   therapeutic approach. however, they all have genomic imprinting defects
   which can inhibit differentiation and may even cause cancer. recently,
   it was reported that dysregulation of the dlk1-dio3 imprinted domain is
   the only notable difference between es cells and ips cells (stadtfeld,
   m. et al. nature, 2010). indeed, hypermethylation and aberrant
   expression of the imprinted genes were observed at the dlk1-dio3
   imprinted region in ips cells therefore, it is important to know how to
   manipulate the genomic imprinting machinery in pluripotent stem cells
   including ips and ntes cells so that proper development of different
   lineages of cells can be achieved for therapeutic applications.â
   â â â  the current major focus of our lab is to analyze acquisition and
   maintenance of genomic imprinting in stem cells as well as in mouse
   embryos. recently, we discovered that zfp57 is highly enriched in es
   cells and is a key regulator in genomic imprinting at multiple
   imprinted regions including the dlk1-dio3 domain. loss of zfp57 results
   in loss of dna methylation genomic imprints at these imprinted regions.
   consistent with our finding, mutations in human zfp57 result in
   hypomethylation at multiple imprinted regions. currently we are
   actively investigating the underlying mechanisms of zfp57-associated
   complexes in the acquisition and maintenance of dna methylation
   imprints in both mouse embryos and es cells.
   mechanisms in genomic imprinting
   â â â  despite that genomic imprinting was identified in mammals almost
   three decades ago, many unanswered questions persist about the nature
   of genomic imprinting memory and about how genomic imprints are
   established and maintained. zfp57 has both maternal and zygotic
   functions and it exhibits maternal-zygotic embryonic lethality, the
   first one identified in mammals. zfp57 maintains both paternal and
   maternal genomic imprints and may target dna methyltransferases to the
   imprinting control regions (icr). interestingly, these germline-derived
   differential dna methylation imprints at the icrs can be lost in
   embryos in the absence of both maternal and zygotic zfp57 and they can
   be acquired in mouse embryos in the presence of zygotic zfp57 even
   though they are not established in the germline. moreover, acquisition
   of dna methylation in mouse embryos occurs in an allele-specific
   fashion, suggesting the presence of dna methylation-independent
   heritable imprinting memory such as heritable histone modifications.
   therefore, further functional analysis of zfp57 in genomic imprinting
   will help us to achieve a better understanding of the molecular nature
   of imprinting memory as well as the temporal and developmental control
   of dna methylation imprints.
   modeling complex human diseases
   â â â  dysregulation of imprinting genes can lead to cancer,
   neurological diseases, diabetes and other kinds of human diseases.
   indeed, mutations in human zfp57 are associated with transient neonatal
   diabetes, congenital heart defects and abnormal development of the
   nervous system. we have independently discovered that zfp57 mutant
   mouse is obese and display similar defects in the cardiovascular
   system. thus, our zfp57 mutant mouse could serve as useful animal
   models for complex human diseases such as obesity, diabetes and
   cardiovascular diseases.
   figure 1.â  rna in-situ hybridization reveals that zfp57 is expressed
   specifically in the oocytes (purple stain) within the follicles.
   .
   figure 2.â zfp57 is involved in the acquisition, maintenance and
   re-acquisition of dna methylation genomic imprints. paternal

   embryo. -/+, a heterozygous zfp57 embryo derived from a null female.
   differential dna methylation at the cpg sites of imprinting control
   regions (icr) is reset during gametogenesis. in sperm, the cpg sites at
   the ig-dmr (ig) of the dlk1-dio3 imprinted domain are methylated while
   those at the snrpn dmr (sn) are unmethylated. by contrast, methylation
   occurs at the snrpn dmr but not at the ig-dmr in the ooytes derived
   from wild-type females. upon fertilization, differential methylation is
   reconstituted at the icrs in the wild-type zygote (zygote (1)). these
   germline-derived differential dna methylation imprints are resistant to
   genome-wide pronuclear demethylation in the zygote and stably
   maintained in wild-type embryos. without zygotic zfp57, differential
   dna methylation is partially lost in the zygotic mutant embryos around
   mid-gestation (midgestation embryo (a)). when both maternal and zygotic
   zfp57 are absent, differential dna methylation is completely missing in
   the mid-gestation maternal-zygotic mutant embryos (midgestation embryo
   (b)). without maternal zfp57, dna methylation is not established at the
   cpg sites of the snrpn dmr in the oocytes derived from zfp57 homozygous
   female mice. in pre-implantation embryos lacking maternal zfp57 (zygote
   (2)), differential dna methylation at the snrpn dmr remains absent.
   intriguingly, differential dna methylation is re-acquired
   allele-specifically at the maternal chromosome of the snrpn dmr in the
   presence of the zygotic zfp57 in about 50% of the heterozygous embryos
   derived from null female mice (li et al., 2008).

   â â â the focus of our research is to understand the molecular and
   cellular nature of the undifferentiated stem cell "states", and how
   such states are altered during a change in cell fate. the underlying
   rationale for our studies is that the complement of gene-products and
   their inter-relationships that exist in stem cells accounts for their
   remarkable abilities to balance self-renewal and differentiation
   decision processes. we study both adult and embryonic stem (es) cells,
   primarily from the mouse, but also from the human. as a first step, we
   have comprehensively identified most, if not all gene-products that are
   expressed in highly purified hematopoietic stem cell (hsc). we
   performed similar analyses in mouse es cells. such molecular
   "signatures" provide parts-lists that are available to the stem cells.
   the challenge has been to functionally address the roles that these
   molecules play in mediating the biological properties of hsc and es
   cells. further, we would like to understand how these molecular
   components are "wired" into regulatory signaling and transcriptional
   networks.
   â â â to explore these issues we have utilized a number of global
   gene-expression perturbation technologies, such as inhibitory short
   hairpin rna (shrna). we have successfully down regulated the expression
   levels of candidate regulatory molecules in both hsc and es cells. a
   number of these play crucial regulatory roles in processes such as
   self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. we have further
   developed strategies that allow the analyses of cell-fate change
   dynamics at multiple biochemical and molecular levels in response to
   defined and precisely controlled changes in the expression levels of
   key regulatory molecules. these strategies have provided the first
   in-depth view of how a cell-fate decision actually occurs at the
   transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and
   post-translational levels. an important aspect of our overall efforts
   is computational and quantitative analyses. we anticipate that our
   approach will yield a systems biology level description and
   understanding of stem cell decision processes. this in turn, will have
   profound implications in future efforts focused on applying basic stem
   cell research in translational as well as clinical contexts.

   â â â â â â my research is focused on defining the cellular and
   molecular nature of hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) and the molecular
   cross-talk that occurs between stem cells and their niche. we use
   transgenic mouse models to study hsc during normal homeostasis and
   after stress. we are interested in the basic property of self-renewal
   and whether hscs really do self-renew to full functional potential when
   they undergo cell division. the lab is also using specific factors to
   directly induce hemogenesis from somatic cells, both mouse and human.
   we have shown that the induction process recapitulates developmental
   hematopoies and molecular cues from these studies have led to a new
   investigation of hsc precursor populations during embryonic
   development. overall our studies will have broad implications on the
   behavior of all stem cells including those that contribute to
   metastatic cancer and leukemias.â

   summary of research studies:
   perhaps the most fundamental process in biology is that by which one
   cell becomes two. our research focuses on two related aspects of the
   biology that controls the integrity of the genome.
   1. we study the control of the cell division cycle, and the signaling
   pathways (checkpoints) that respond to chromosomal damage and prevent
   cell cycle progression until that damage is repaired.
   dna damage checkpoints function throughout the cell cycle. those
   working in g1 phase to prevent the replication of damaged dna are
   almost invariably mutated or inactivated in cancers. these defects
   contribute not only to the instability of tumor cell genomes, but can
   also knock-out pro-apoptotic pathways, rendering tumors resistant to
   treatment. those functioning in g2 phase to prevent commitment to
   mitosis are, however, virtually always intact and appear to be required
   for the viability of tumor cells that lack g1 checkpoints. our research
   is geared to dissect the molecular and cell biology of g2 checkpoints,
   and aims to use this knowledge in the design and testing of targeted
   anti-cancer therapies. taking genetic and genomic approaches, we
   utilize fission yeast as a gene and pathway discovery tool, and then
   apply this information to studies in human cells. we are currently
   focusing our efforts into: (1) the regulation and function of a
   checkpoint effector protein kinase, chk1, informing its suitability as
   modify lesions in dna into structures that signal the checkpoint and
   can be repaired.
   2. we are investigating how determinants of chromosome structure
   regulate chromosome segregation and dna repair, with an emphasis on
   events that occur during dna replication.
   chromosomes are highly dynamic structures. they undergo massive
   reorganization to enable dna replication and chromosome segregation to
   occur. this is under the control of the dna topoisomerases, and three
   related and interacting structural maintenance of chromosomes (smc)
   complexes known as cohesin, condensin and the smc5/6 complex. defects
   in the processes controlled by these enzymes are a potent inducer of
   chromosome segregation defects leading to changes in chromosome number
   (aneuploidy). their function during dna replication appears to be
   particularly important, where they control recombination to ensure a
   complete round of replication by overcoming obstacles that block
   polymerases, which is then followed by chromosome reorganization in
   preparation for mitosis.  with the importance of replication fidelity,
   cells have back-up mechanisms controlled by a multi-brct domain protein
   (brc1/ptip) and the post-replication repair (prr) machinery. we are
   focusing our efforts to understanding how these various genome
   integrity determinants are integrated in time and space to ensure
   accurate replication and division of the genome.

   the main research interest of my laboratory is in understanding the
   mechanisms of cancer metastasis via the lymphatic system and the
   function of lymphatic vessels in the regulation of immune response.
   metastasis is the main cause of treatment failure and death for cancer
   patients. the first site to which cancer cells metastasize are lymph
   nodes, and the extent of lymph node involvement is a major criterion
   for evaluating patient prognosis and the choice of therapy. despite the
   fact that the importance of the lymphatic system as a pathway for
   cancer metastasis has been well recognized, research efforts over the
   past decades have been focused primarily on understanding the
   mechanisms of tumor spread via the blood vasculature. thus, the
   mechanisms of tumor spread via the lymphatic system remain poorly
   understood. aside from serving as a transport system for tumor cells,
   the lymphatic system normally collects extravasated fluid,
   macromolecules and leukocytes from tissues and returns them to the
   blood circulation. by directing antigen-presenting cells, t-cells and
   antigens from peripheral tissues into the lymph nodes, lymphatic
   vessels play an important role in the initiation of immune response.
   however, the mechanisms by which leukocytes are mobilized into the
   lymphatic vessels are poorly understood, and in particular, the role of
   lymphatic vessels in the process remains unknown.
   our long-term research efforts are dedicated towards elucidating the
   molecular mechanisms which regulate lymphatic vessel growth (i.e.
   lymphangiogenesis) and the function of lymphatic vessels in cancer and
   in normal physiology. current research includes investigations of the
   mechanisms by which tumor cells interact with the lymphatic vasculature
   during early steps of metastasis. we are investigating the role of role
   of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules expressed by the lymphatic
   endothelium in tumor invasion and metastasis, to gain insight into the
   mechanisms which regulate tumor cell migration and entry into the
   lymphatic vessels. we are also investigating the molecular mechanisms
   of lymphangiogenesis. our previous studies have demonstrated that the
   induction of tumor lymphangiogenesis by the vascular endothelial growth
   factor-c (vegf-c) facilitates tumor metastases. the goals of our
   current research activities are to better understand the mechanisms by
   which vegf-c promotes metastasis and to assess the potential of vegf-c
   and its receptors as targets for the anti-metastatic therapy. our
   efforts are also dedicated towards identification of novel
   lymphangiogenic factors and markers of the lymphatic endothelium.
   finally, the lab is exploring the role of lymphatic vasculature in the
   regulation of immune response, particularly its function in regulating
   migration and activation of antigen-presenting cells. the ultimate goal
   of these studies is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by
   which lymphatic endothelial cells control physiological cell migration
   and to examine whether tumor cells take advantage of these mechanisms
   to gain access to the lymphatic vessels. the knowledge gained with the
   above studies may provide a foundation for the development of new
   therapeutic approaches to predict, arrest and treat cancer metastases.

   research in my laboratory centers on developing computational
   techniques for the modeling and understanding of complex molecular
   systems such as proteins and nucleic acids in their aqueous
   environments. the methods developed are applied to problems of interest
   in structural biology. methodological developments focus on novel
   techniques to calculate free energy from computer simulations, on
   extending the range of applicability of grand-canonical ensemble
   simulations, on enhancing monte carlo sampling algorithms and on
   developing novel approaches to the analysis and visualization of
   macromolecular structures and computer simulation results. these
   techniques are applied to the calculation of the solvent contribution
   to conformational free energy differences between various conformation
   lipid bilayers. in addition, ligand-protein interactions are studied by
   docking tecniques and by molecular dynamics. recent work showed that
   grand-canonical ensemble simulations can be used to predict sites for
   derivatizing a ligand in order to enhance its binding affinity.

   what causes aging and age-related diseases, especially obesity,
   diabetes, and alzheimer's disease?
   the metabolic mystery: obesity and diabetes (a surfeit of nutritional
   resources) accelerate many age-related diseases, and dietary
   restriction (a dearthof nutritional resources) slows down aging itself
   and almost all age-related diseases. what's up with that?
   can we develop a drug to mimic all the protective effects of dietary
   restriction? (yes!)
   our laboratory uses histological, behavioral, electrophysiological, and
   molecular, methods (including dna microarrays and rna interference) to
   assess the basic mechanisms by which hypothalamic neurons sense and
   regulate metabolic state (including body weight and food intake), and
   how these mechanisms are impaired in metabolic diseases and during
   aging. a driving question of our laboratory is what may be called the
   metabolic mystery. this refers to the fascinating phenomenon that
   obesity is a risk factor for most age-related diseases and indeed for
   mortality, and conversely dietary restriction appears to slow down the
   aging process and extend maximum lifespan. considering that almost all
   major pathologies are influenced by caloric intake, the mechanisms
   underlying the metabolic mystery may be considered among the most
   compelling in biomedical science. we really don't understand why
   caloric intake should lead to diseases, but many lines of evidence
   suggest neuroendocrine mechanisms. we have begun to study the nature of
   the hypothalamic neurons which are sensitive to nutrition and which in
   turn regulate metabolic state, and we have thus begun to define a
   "nutritional field" of neurons which contain overlapping domains
   sensitive to different nutrients and which regulate different aspects
   of metabolism. of particular interest is that the maximum overlap of
   these nutritional stimulation (e.g., glucose and leptin) may occur
   within the pomc neurons, which we now believe play a critical role in
   regulating metabolism. this is particularly interesting because the
   pomc neurons are among the most sensitive to decline during aging. to
   begin to directly test the role of specific gene products in the
   development of obesity, diabetes, and aging, we have now produced
   several lines of transgenic mice that overexpress leptin, pomc,
   insulin, and glucokinase specifically in the brain, and we are now
   assessing the effects of these transgenes in obesity, diabetes, and
   aging. for example, we have now shown that transgenic enhancement of
   neuronal pomc will completely correct the diabetes and other
   impairments in genetically obese mice. these studies have led to
   discovery of a new class of anti-obesity drugs that we are now
   studying. a new direction in our laboratory involves examining function
   of metabolic genes we have discovered using microarrays using rna
   interference protocols in mice and in c. elegans. using high-throughput
   rnai screening methods we have discovered over 20 novel genes that
   regulate obesity in c. elegans. using a similar approach we have also
   discovered a transcriptional complex that mediates the protective
   effects of dietary restriction to increase lifespan and protect against
   age-related diseases, including alzheimer-type pathology and diabetic
   complications. pharmacological activation of this pathway increases
   lifespan and protects against neurodegenerative diseases, and the same
   complex predicts lifespan and obesity in mice. we have now also
   developed novel high-throughput methods to discover novel anti-obesity
   and anti-diabetes drugs, and have discovered over 20 drugs in each
   class so far.
   what is the hypothesis?
   a key observation about the nature of age-related impairments is that
   these impairments accrue over time, reflecting a cumulative and
   apparently irreversible process. we have now discovered the molecular
   mechanism of this "molecular memory" effect and shown that it applies
   to all age-related diseases that are influenced by dietary restriction.
   in particular this process explains the cumulative development of
   diabetic complications, and implies that both age-related impairments
   and diabetic complications can not only be slowed (as with dietary
   restriction) but can actually be reveresed, by blocking glucose
   metabolism more effectively than can be done with dietary restriction.

   we work on synaptic plasticity, the aging brain, and the synaptic basis
   of age-related cognitive decline. we are particularly interested in the
   distinction between alzheimer's disease (ad) and the more modest
   disruption of memory often referred to as age-associated cognitive
   impairment or mild cognitive impairment (mci) that often occurs in the
   context of normal aging. while age-associated cognitive impairment
   represents a major health problem on its own that must be solved,
   preventing the transition from mci to ad is a related goal of enormous
   importance given the rising threat and cost of ad to western society.
   in order to achieve either goal, we need to understand the cellular,
   synaptic, and molecular basis of the earliest age-related alterations
   that lead to cognitive decline and how these events relate to the
   complex physiology of aging, such as the aging of endocrine systems
   that affect the brain, or the interactions between stress and aging.
   for example, in ad, the cortical neurons that provide the complex
   connections that mediate cognition degenerate, leading to the
   catastrophic loss of cognitive function evident in dementia. unlike ad,
   significant neuron death does not occur in normal aging and thus does
   not appear to be the cause of the initial stages of age-associated
   cognitive impairment. while these circuits do not die in normal aging,
   we have shown that they are vulnerable to sub-lethal age-related
   alterations in structure, synaptic integrity, and molecular processing
   at the synapse, all of which impair cognitive function in
   well-characterized animal models. in addition, while synapse loss
   occurs in aging, all synapses are not equally vulnerable and all
   regions do not age the same way. our recent data on prefrontal cortex
   show that there is a selective loss of the class of synapses that is
   most plastic and likely to play a critical role in the cognitive
   processes mediated by prefrontal cortex, yet the age-related synaptic
   alterations in hippocampus are quite different, with minimal synapse
   loss. biochemical alterations of the synapse, such as shifts in
   distribution or abundance of key neurotransmitter receptors, may also
   contribute to memory impairment, particularly in hippocampus.
   we have shown that the same brain regions and circuits vulnerable to
   aging are responsive to circulating estrogen levels, suggesting that
   critical interactions between reproductive senescence and brain aging
   may affect excitatory synaptic transmission and cognitive performance.
   in fact, estrogen treatment in aged female monkeys protected the
   vulnerable class of synapses and restored cognitive performance to that
   of young monkeys. importantly, the effects of estrogen on these neurons
   show that certain age-associated synaptic alterations may be
   reversible, leading to the protection of cognitive performance observed
   in these monkeys. these effects of estrogen give us a molecular and
   therapeutic entry point to explore additional interventions and
   strategies to protect against synaptic aging. if we can prevent the
   synaptic aging of these circuits while still largely intact, we may be
   able to protect individuals against the earliest stages of cognitive
   decline and in turn, prevent the transition to the death of these
   circuits that underlies ad.
   a parallel area of research in our lab investigates the effects of
   behavioral stress on neurons in the prefrontal cortex. we have shown
   that stress leads to dendritic retraction on pyramidal neurons in
   prefrontal cortex, and this leads to cognitive decline. importantly, if
   stress is discontinued these neurons recover, both structurally and
   functionally. in addition, the specific neuronal responses to stress
   differ between males and females. all of these studies were done in
   young animals, but recently, we were able to link our investigations
   into neuronal aging with our interest in behaviorally (i.e., stress)-
   induced plasticity. while the dendrites of prefrontal neurons in young
   animals recover from stress-induced retraction, this capacity for
   recovery is absent in middle-aged and aged animals. furthermore,
   prefrontal neurons in middle-aged and aged rats lose spines with aging
   in the absence of stress and are further stress-induced synaptic loss
   or plasticity.  we are now pursuing the mechanisms responsible for
   age-related loss of experience dependent plasticity.

   dr. zhang's multiscale network modeling laboratory (mnml) is focused on
   construction and characterization of multiscale biological networks
   from large-scale genomic, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic and clinical
   data. the fundamental goal of mnml's research is to not only identify
   novel pathways and driver genes for complex human diseases but also
   build up biologically plausible mechanistic models of diseases for
   subsequent experimental and clinical validations. mnml has developed
   and significantly contributed a series of influential gene network
   inference algorithms that have been extensively used for identification
   of novel pathways and gene targets, as well as development of drugs for
   complex human diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, alzheimer's,
   obesity and diabetes. mnml's latest research that uncovered dramatic
   changes in gene-gene interaction patterns in alzheimer's disease and
   pinpointed an immune/microglia gene network as the top pathway causally
   linked to the disease was just published in cell. dr. zhang's recent
   research that sheds a new light on targeted therapies against breast
   cancer was featured in a press release by the aacr basic cancer
   research conference in 2011. dr. zhang's work on predicting genetic
   interactions was identified by nature biotechnology as one of the
   breakthroughs in the field of computational biology in 2010. the
   discovery of a gene cluster that is causally linked to obesity and
   diabetes was highlighted in nature in 2008.

   the goal of our research is to better understand the molecular
   mechanisms of addiction and depression. we use animal models of these
   disorders to identify the ways in which long-term exposure to drugs of
   abuse or stress changes the brain to lead to addiction- or
   depression-like syndromes. a major focus of our work is on drug- and
   stress-induced changes in gene expression and chromatin structure
   within the brain's reward circuitry.
    we use human pluripotent stem cells to understand the mechanisms of
   malignant and non-malignant genetic blood diseases and to develop new
   therapies. we are harnessing somatic cell reprogramming and genetic
   engineering technologies to develop new models of normal and abnormal
   hematopoiesis. by capturing and introducing disease-associated genetic
   mutations and large chromosomal deletions in patient-derived induced
   pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) we study their phenotypic and functional
   consequences, attempt to reconstruct the genetic history of leukemia
   progression and seek to identify new therapeutic targets through
   genetic and chemical screens.

   even though individually rare, developmental disorders are common as a
   group: about 1 in 6 children in the u.s. were reported as having a
   developmental disability in the screening period of 2006-2008 (please
   visit the website of the centers for disease control and prevention).
   the neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds) we study include autism
   spectrum disorders (asd), intellectual disability (id) and epilepsy.
   we are dedicated to understanding the relationship between a personâs
   genes and neurodevelopmental disorders in order to help patients and
   families.
   understanding the causes of these disorders may in the future improve
   the ability to diagnose and treat children with neurodevelopmental
   disorders.
   autism spectrum disorders (asd) â autism spectrum disorders impact a
   childâs development in a number of ways: limited or unusual language
   and speech development limited or impaired social skills, and the
   presence of ritualistic or repetitive behaviors that often limit
   typical social development.
   intellectual disability (id) â intellectual disability is characterized
   by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in
   adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical
   skills, starting before 18 years old.
   epilepsy â 20 to 35 % of children with autism have seizures or develop
   epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. in turn, individuals with
   new-onset epilepsy can experience developmental and cognitive delays.
   these conditions frequently overlap with one another, in addition to
   other ndds and sometimes physical anomalies. there is very strong
   evidence that the same genetic variants can contribute to all three
   conditions, asd, id, and epilepsy. patients with different clinical
   presentations within the ndds spectrum can have mutations in the same
   gene, or in the same region that controls gene function. although
   several genes have been identified for autism, and to a lesser extent
   for epilepsy, the etiology remains unknown in most affected
   individuals.
   we are interested in understanding how genetic changes can lead to the
   emergence and co-ocurrence of various ndds. with a better understanding
   of the biological basis of ndds, scientists and doctors can hope to
   bring families and patients more personalized care and effective
   treatment in the future.
   neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds), such as developmental delay,
   autism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability are frequent in children
   and can have a genetic basis.
   we are interested in learning how genetic changes can affect brain
   development, and, subsequently, lead to disease. this study will
   examine similarities and differences in the genes of people with ndds
   and their family members.
   ndds can co-occur in the same family or the same person, suggesting
   that they may be caused by similar or related genetic changes. by
   mapping both shared and distinct changes we will better understand the
   biological basis of each disorder.
   subjects and their family members will donate a blood sample, in the
   same way blood is drawn at a doctorâs office. all samples will be given
   an anonymous code number, and used only for research purposes. no names
   or personal information will be linked to the samples.
   in a large percentage of ndds patients, the genetic changes have not
   yet been identified. this study will use your samples for research
   purposes only, meaning that what we learn from the analysis of an
   individual's sample has no direct benefit for the individual. however,
   by gathering information from many individuals, we hope to learn more
   about how changes affecting genes can lead to ndds.
   the participation of many individuals with ndds and their family
   members is the necessary foundation for making these discoveries.
   children and young adults with a diagnosis of intellectual disability
   and/or autism spectrum disorders and/or epilepsy with unknown cause.
   parents and family members of those with ndds are eligible to
   participate whether or not they have ndds. research is usually more
   informative when both parents are enrolled in their childâs study.
   if you agree to participate, a questionnaire will be completed, you
   will participate in an interview, and donate a blood sample.

   as chief of the image acquisition core, dr. o'halloran's work is
   focused on bringing innovative new imaging techniques to bear on
   problems in basic and clinical research. his primary area of focus is
   on diffusion weighted imaging (dwi), in particular on high-resolution
   dwi. at high spatial resolution, dwi allows visualization of the white
   matter pathways that connect functional areas of the brain. one
   application of this technique that dr. o'halloran is focused on is in
   the planning of deep brain stimulation surgery to treat conditions such
   as parkinson's disease, dystonia, and depression. dr. o'halloran's
   other interests include image reconstruction and motion correction.
   patient motion continues to be a major problem in mri, causing failed
   or prolonged exams which ultimately results in increased heath care
   costs. solutions to patient motion can be implemented on both the
   acquisition and image reconstruction side, and can potentially benefit
   a wide range of mr imaging techniques.

   drug discovery target identification and validation to meet the needs
   of patients has become even more challenging in spite of the huge
   amounts of genomic and metabolomic data available today.  close
   collaboration between biological and chemical sciences is vital to
   determine biological mechanisms of disease and to discover approaches
   to positively impact the disease state through intervention using
   molecular therapeutics. the research program of our laboratory is to
   develop novel chemical and biological tools in collaboration with our
   colleagues across the wide variety of therapeutic areas of interest to
   the mount sinai research community.  targets meeting sufficient
   criteria of validation have the opportunity to enter into the drug
   discovery portfolio of the experimental therapeutics institute.
    the laboratory supports many drug discovery and development activities
   including:
   -      evaluation of high throughput and virtual screens
   -      hit validation and follow-up
   -      lead identification
   -     chemical tools for in vivo studies in preclinical animal models
   of disease
   -  lead optimization with the eventual goal of  identification of
   candidates for clinical studies.
   in addition, an important focus of the laboratory is to develop key
   chemical and biochemical tools necessary to create translational and
   target engagement biomarkers, including imaging agents, to further
   understand the impact on disease states and underlying biology to
   effectively intervene in the designated disease pathway.
   the laboratory works toward the identification of novel chemical matter
   by developing new chemical processes and syntheses in the areas of
   heterocyclic chemistry and carbon-carbon bond forming reactions to
   access unexploited chemical space.

   dna damage and repair
   the long-term goal of this project is to develop a molecular
   understanding, derived from a combined theoretical-experimental
   collaborative approach, of the principles of specific dna damage
   recognition and repair. the collaboration is between this laboratory
   and that of j. b. alexander ross.
   two mechanisms of damage repair are important for the maintenance of
   the genetic material encoded in dna. one is the excision of the damage
   followed by a restoration of the correct dna sequence in a number of
   coordinated steps represented by the base excision pathway (ber). the
   other repair process is accomplished by an error-free translesion
   synthesis. we study the mechanism of damage recognition and its
   excision by two repair enzymes: endonuclease v (endov) recognizes a
   thymine dimer (td) and flips the complementary adenine to the 5-thymine
   of the td into a protein pocket before hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond
   of the td. uracil dna glycosylase (udg) recognizes uracil in dna, flips
   it into a specific pocket and hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond. it
   appears that the mechanism of base flipping is universal to base
   excision repair. thus, this project concentrates on understanding the
   molecular, energetic and kinetic elements that differentiate base
   flipping in damaged from undamaged dna.
   specificity of enzymes is determined not only by the recognition event,
   but also by the catalytic mechanism. the enzymatic catalysis of ber
   enzymes begins with a glycosylase step. the ionization states of
   several groups in the active sites of endov or udg are important for
   catalysis. we have computed the pka values of the amino acids in the
   active site of endov and on this basis we propose a catalytic mechanism
   of the glycosylase step in the enzyme (fuxreiter, m. warshel, a. osman,
   r. the role of active site residues in the glycosylase step of t4
   endonuclease v. computer simulation studies on ionization states.
   biochemistry, 38:9577-9589,1999). we have studied by md simulations the
   reactant and product states of udg in complex with its substrate and on
   the basis of structural, electrostatic and dynamic changes we propose a
   mechanism of catalysis for the enzyme (luo, n. mehler, e. osman, r.

   dynamics study of reactant and product complexes with dna.

    in our daily lives we often encounter both pleasurable and aversive
   situations, which heighten our emotional state and affect cognition.
   the ability to flexibly regulate our emotions in response to such
   events is essential for adapting to our environment and, ultimately,
   for our mental health. many forms of mental illness involve dysfunction
   in the neural systems that regulate affective processing and decision
   making. the limbic system, which includes parts of the prefrontal
   cortex and medial temporal lobe, is critical for regulating emotions
   and plays an essential role in cognition. the main focus of the
   rudebeck lab is to understand how interaction between the prefrontal
   cortex and subcortical structures such as the amygdala contribute to
   emotional regulation and decision-making. to do this, we use a
   combination of behavioral, autonomic, neurophysiological and
   interference methods in animal models.

   overview.
   â â â  the liver accomplishes an amazing array of physiological tasks,
   including energy homeostasis, xenobiotic metabolism, serum protein
   secretion and bile production. despite the remarkable regenerative
   capacity of the liver, it is not always able to undergo efficient
   repair, and diseases of the liver are common. our lab uses zebrafish to
   understand liver development and disease.
   the role of uhrf1 in liver development.
   figure 1. the liver is well formed in 5 day embryos. a. transgenic fish
   expressing gfp in hepatocytes. b. in situ hybridization with the fabp10
   hepatocyte-specific probe.
   figure 2. the liver is small in 4 day embryos that lack uhrf1. uhrf1
   morphants (bottom 4 larvae) expressing gfp in hepatocytes have small
   livers and developmental defects compared to controls (top)
   is uhrf1 an oncogene?
   â â â  our experiments demonstrate that uhrf1 is required for liver
   growth under physiologic conditions. our next question is to determine
   whether high levels of uhrf1 contribute to unregulated hepatocyte
   proliferation, as is found in hepatocellular carcinoma. to address this
   question, we collaborate with the mount sinai liver cancer research
   program directed by dr. josep llovet. we have found that uhrf1 is
   highly expressed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,
   and studies are underway to establish the significance of this finding.
   how does uhrf1 function to regulate hepatocyte proliferation?
   â â â  recent, exciting data indicates that a primary role of uhrf1 in
   mammals is to direct dna methyl transferase (dnmt1) to hemi-methylated
   dna during replication. uhrf1 is required for maintaining dna
   methylation and loss of uhrf1 causes significant changes in
   methylation. our working model is that zebrafish with depleted uhrf1
   fail to undergo methylation-mediated silencing of genes which halt the
   cell cycle (i.e. tumor suppressors). currently, work in the lab is
   focused on identifying potential important uhrf1 target genes.
   how is uhrf1 regulated?
   figure 3. uhrf1 is localized to the nucleus in mammalian cells.
   the genetics of fatty liver disease
   fatty liver disease is most frequently associated with obesity or
   alcohol abuse, and a range from fat accumulating in hepatocytes
   (steatosis) to the severe steatohepatitis fall under the umbrella of
   this disease. we are using zebrafish genetics to understand the factors
   that contribute to steatosis.
   alcoholic liver disease
   figure 4. acute exposure to ethanol causes steatosis in 4 day zebrafish
   larvae.
   metabolic liver disease
   figure 5. fgr mutants have hepatomegaly (top) and defective hepatocytes
   which do not store glycogen (bottom).
   the fgr gene is highly conserved in animals, and the fgr protein does
   not have any known function. efforts are underway to determine the
   cellular function of fgr and to elucidate the mechanism by which
   mutation of this novel gene gives rise to steatosis.â
   â â â  we find that fgr mutants have defects in protein secretion,
   activation of the unfolded protein response and hepatic endoplasmic
   reticulum (er) stress. current work is focused on determining how
   disruption of the secretory pathway and er stress causes steatosis.

   our lab is interested in understanding how neurotrophic growth factors,
   including nerve growth factor (ngf) and brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor (bdnf), regulate nervous system development and function. we
   study neurotrophin action through the identification of gene products
   that these growth factors regulate in the cns and pns, determining how
   these proteins are involved in neurogenesis, axonal outgrowth and
   pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, using cellular
   and molecular tools, and knockout mouse models. together with the
   benson lab, we're currently examining how the ngf-regulated cell
   surface adhesion protein, called nilegp or l1, an immunoglobulin (ig)
   superfamily member that is expressed primarily in the nervous system,
   regulates axonal outgrowth, branching, pathfinding, and fasciculation,
   as well as neuronal migration. of note, inherited x-linked mutations in
   l1 result in hydrocephalus and mental retardation (crash and masa
   syndromes). in addition, we're trying to understand how the
   neurotrophin-inducible gene vgf, encoding a secreted `granin-like'
   protein and peptide precursor, controls energy expenditure, memory, and
   depressive behavior. recent collaborative studies with the huntley,
   alberini, shapiro, and duman laboratories indicate that vgf-derived
   peptides injected into the brain have anti-depressant efficacy,
   consistent with abnormalities noted in memory tasks and depressed
   behavior in vgf knockout mice, and that vgf regulates hippocampal
   synaptic activity via a bdnf-dependent mechanism. we are developing
   novel conditional and humanized knockout models to better understand
   vgf function in the developing and adult hippocampus, hypothalamus, and
   sympathetic nervous system.

   can we change our emotions? our lab is interested in discovering the
   neural mechanisms underlying emotional control and flexibility. because
   the environment we live in is constantly changing, we need to
   continuously update our emotional responses. in extreme situations,
   when emotional memories become traumatic, we might even wish to 'erase'
   emotional memories altogether. our research team uses neuroimaging,
   pharmacology and psychophysiology to understand the neural mechanisms
   that make such emotional flexibility. we examine emotional processing
   in the normal brain and in patients with anxiety disorders, and hope to
   promote new forms of treatment.
   our lab studies the neural mechanisms of memory in the everyday sense
   of the word: the ability to learn new facts and remember recent events.
   although for many years scientists believed that only one form of
   learning existed in the brain, we now know that different brain
   networks are crucial for different types of learning. for example, the
   hippocampus is needed to learn and remember new facts and recent
   events, the amygdala is crucial for earning emotional associations, and
   the neostriatum is required for certain forms of skill learning. my
   research focuses on how the hippocampus, refrontal cortex, and other
   brain areas contribute to memory in experimental animals, mostly rats,
   and how mechanisms of neuronal plasticity within these structures
   contribute to memory functions. experiments in my lab are guided by
   cognitive, computational, physiological, and pharmacological
   hypotheses.
   the basic idea is that the properties of the nmda receptor allows cells
   in the hippocampus to conjoin temporally overlapping cortical inputs
   into representations of events, and that recurrent connections within
   the hippocampus and between it and other structures allow these events
   to be linked into the sequences that comprise episodic memories.
   interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex allow
   specific memories to guide response rules, and different strategies and
   motives allow the prefrontal cortex to select among memories in
   otherwise identical situations. experiments investigating the links
   between these different levels of analysis are aimed toward providing
   an integrated perspective of memory.
   to study the molecular mechanisms of drug addiction and depression, a
   lot of high throughput experimental data have been generated. our lab
   focuses on the statistical and integrated analysis of these data and
   generates biological insights. we are especially interested in the

   our main research focus is on elucidation of the pathophysiology of
   primary dystonia through the investigations of its neuroimaging,
   neuropathological, clinical, genetic and environmental correlates. we
   are also interested in comparisons of imaging features of dystonia with
   other movement disorders, such as essential tremor and parkinson's
   disease.
   our recent research direction includes studies on functional and
   structural connectome of high frequency networks in epilepsy.
   using multi-disciplinary approach and novel technologies, we are
   developing a better understanding of normal and diseased states of the
   central nervous system, which will ultimately help develop new
   therapeutic options for patients with movement disorders and epilepsy.

   basic functions in the brain, such as making decisions, consuming food
   and forming memories, rely on a proper balance of excitatory and
   inhibitory neuronal signals. our research focuses on the function of
   potassium ion channels, which generate one of the inhibitory signals in
   the brain. we are particularly interested in g protein-regulated
   potassium channels and their role in drug addiction and mental
   disorders. we have unraveled the molecular details underlying g protein
   modulation, elucidated a structural mechanism of alcohol-mediated
   activation, and discovered drug-induced plasticity for these g
   protein-gated potassium channels. as potassium channels emerge as
   critical gatekeepers of neuronal excitability, the results of our
   research may lead to the development of more effective treatments for
   diverse neurological diseases such as epilepsy, down syndrome, alcohol
   abuse and drug addiction.

   dr hiotis is a surgical oncologist at the mount sinai school of
   medicine. he received his md degree from the university of maryland,
   and also holds a phd in immunology. dr hiotis trained in general
   surgery at the university of south florida in tampa, and in surgical
   oncology at the memorial sloan-kettering cancer center in new york. he
   has a strong interest in cancers of the liver and gastrointestinal
   tract. in addition to clinical practice in surgical oncology, dr hiotis
   is currently actively engaged in both clinical and laboratory research.
   he is currently the principal investigator of an independently funded
   scientific research project, which focuses on the interaction between
   hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with
   hepatitis b. this project involves both a retrospective and prospective
   component. the prospective arm includes a tumor banking protocol, from
   which over 100 human tumor and non-neoplastic liver parenchymal
   specimens have already been collected and cryopreserved. this is a
   highly unique tumor bank, and only includes hepatocellular cancers from
   patients with hepatitis b. a broad spectrum of tumors have already been
   collected from patients with varying degrees of underlying hepatic
   fibrosis, which is a unique characteristic seen in patients with
   hepatitis b associated hepatocellular carcinoma. dr hiotisâ hepatitis
   b-hepatocellular carcinoma research project is designed to evaluate
   differences in hepatocellular carcinoma that arise in patients with
   underlying cirrhosis, vs. those cancers that arise instead in livers
   with minimal or moderate fibrosis. his additional research activities
   also include participation in clinical trials for treatment of liver
   and gastrointestinal cancers, and basic science research focusing on
   cancer immunotherapy in a mouse model for hepatocellular carcinoma.
   dr.  hiotis is currently the vice chairman for surgical research at
   mount sinai. in this role, dr. hiotis administrates the coordinated
   clinical and basic science research efforts of a large department,
   including ten divisions and multiple full-time faculty members. he
   supervises the departmentâs research fellows, coordinators, and
   assistants.
   in addition to his administrative responsibilities in research, dr.
   hiotis also maintains a research endeavor of his own, oversees a basic
   science laboratory, and is the principal investigator of
   independently-funded scientific research. he is also actively engaged
   in several clinical trials.

   dr. aaronson is an internationally recognized cancer biologist, who in
   early studies established the transformation-competent but replication
   defective nature of mammalian sarcoma viruses and molecularly cloned
   many of their oncogenes. he and colleagues implicated
   retroviral-related oncogenes in human cancer through investigations
   including the initial detection of their expression in human tumors and
   critical contributions to the demonstration of their involvement in
   human cancer. his investigations of the v-sis oncogene established the
   first normal function of an oncogene and the role of oncogenes in
   growth factor signaling. his discovery of erbb2 as a v-erbb-related
   gene amplified in a human breast carcinoma and demonstration of its
   transforming properties paved the way for targeted therapies directed
   against its product.
   he isolated kgf (fgf7), a growth factor with novel epithelial cell
   specificity and demonstrated its involvement in wound repair. its
   successful phase iii clinical trial by amgen for treatment of
   mucositis, recently led the fda to approve kepivance (kgf) for
   treatment of this debilitating side effect of many cancer therapies.
   thus, dr. aaronson's pioneering discoveries have directly led to new
   therapies for cancer patients.
   his development and application of stable expression cdna cloning
   technology resulted in his identification of new human oncogenes,
   growth factor receptors, and other genes, which induce transformation
   or drug resistance. he and colleagues identified the protooncogene
   product, met, as the receptor for hgf/scatter factor and lrp5/6 as the
   receptor for a novel wnt antagonist, dkk1. this latter discovery paved
   the way for his recent demonstration with colleagues of a wnt autocrine
   transforming mechanism in human malignancies.
   dr. aaronson received his m.d. from ucsf in 1966. he joined the
   national institutes of health in 1967 and became chief of the
   laboratory of cellular and molecular biology at the national cancer
   institute in 1977. he joined mount sinai in 1994 and is the jack and
   jane b. aron professor and founding chair, emeritus of the department
   of oncological sciences. he is the recipient of numerous awards
   including the distinguished service medal from the u.s. public health
   service, the rhoads memorial award from the american association of
   cancer research, and the paul erhlich prize from germany. he is the
   author of over 530 publications, an inventor on more than 50 patents,
   and serves on numerous editorial boards and scientific advisory
   committees.

   research
   we use a multidisciplinary approach that combines behavioral,
   morphological, electrophysiological, cell biological and
   molecular-biological techniques to explain the neural basis of those
   forms of behavioral plasticity that are due to changes in the internal
   state of the organism. our primary interest is in mechanisms that
   establish internal states and in memory mechanisms that are responsible
   for persistence of these states.
   we have chosen to study internal states in a preparation that has a
   relatively simple nervous system - the marine mollusc aplysia
   californica. the central nervous system of this animal is distributed
   into several ganglia, each of which consists of a limited number of
   neurons, many of which are large and easily identifiable as unique
   individuals.
   the ability to recognize the same neurons from animal to animal has
   greatly facilitated the functional characterization of individual cells
   as sensory neurons, motor neurons and interneurons. this in turn has
   allowed the reconstruction of neuronal circuits that mediate a variety
   of behaviors. circuit-level analysis has provided new insights into the
   organization of neuronal networks into mediating and modulatory systems
   and led to a new conceptualization of command neurons.
   studies of transmitters and modulators involved in the regulation of
   behavior have resulted in purification and sequencing of several novel
   neuropeptides and to molecular cloning of the mrna of these molecules.
   these neuropeptides have now been localized to specific neurons, and
   shown to act as cotransmitters. to a large extent our research is now
   focused on the role that these peptidergic cotransmitters play in
   optimizing the efficiency of behavior in response to changes in the
   motivational state of the animal. we are particularly interested in
   determining:
   we expect that this approach will yield a unified picture in which our
   understanding of behavioral plasticity will extend all the way from
   behavior to the molecules involved.

   our research focuses on the cellular mechanisms underlying cns
   disorders and their treatment. we use advanced genetic mouse models,
   viral mediated gene transfer and optogenetics to understand the network
   and cell type specific mechanisms underlying chronic pain, addiction,
   and depression.   a large part of our work, concerns the study of rgs
   proteins (regulators of g protein signaling) in the brain.  rgs
   proteins modulate a number of important functions in the cns by
   regulating the activity of heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunits but
   also by various other interactions which affect receptor
   desentitization, ion channel function or transcriptional activity.  our
   earlier work revealed a potent role of rgs9-2 in the striatum in drug
   addiction and identified rgs9-2 complexes associated with agonist
   biased signaling. more recently, we explored the role of rgs4 in
   antidepressant drug actions and its role in various forms of chronic
   pain.
   we focus on five major research areas:
   signal transduction complexes in the striatum in drug addiction
   regulation of g protein signaling in stress and depression
   novel intracellular targets for chronic pain treatment
   epigenetic adaptations in chronic pain models
   regulators of g protein signaling and obesity

   ubiquitin signaling in cancer biology
    post-doctoral fellows: kenneth wu and xinson xu
   graduate student: jordan kovacev
   covalent linkage of ubiquitin chains to cellular proteins leads to
   targeted degradation by the 26s proteasome, thus promoting
   unidirectional alteration of a divergent array of cellular processes
   that include cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and tumor
   suppression.
   central to the ubiquitination reaction are the recognition of a
   substrate by an e3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which also functions to
   recruit an e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that catalyzes the transfer
   of ubiquitin to the target protein. work from this laboratory has
   helped uncovering a super-family of cullin-roc1 ring based e3 ligases.
   we are focusing on scf, the prototype of cullin-ring e3, with specific
   interest to understand the mechanisms by which it targets protein
   substrates for polyubiquitination and eventual proteasomal
   degradation.  given its broad spectrum of protein targets, the scf
   pathway profoundly impacts a wide range of biological processes,
   including cell growth and death, development, signal transduction,
   transcriptional control, genomic integrity, and tumor suppression.
   we have discovered an scf-like e3 ligase complex containing cul7, fbw8,
   skp1 and roc1. dysregulation of the cul7 e3 ligase has been directly
   linked to hereditary human diseases as cul7 germline mutations were
   found in patients with autosomal-recessive 3-m and yakuts short stature
   syndromes, which are characterized by profound pre- and postnatal
   growth retardation. recently, we have identified insulin receptor
   substrate 1, a critical mediator of insulin and insulin-like growth
   factor-1 signaling, as the proteolytic target of the cul7 e3 ligase,
   suggesting a role for cul7 as a novel growth regulator. we are
   currently exploring pathomechanistic insights into cul7-linked growth
   retardation syndromes.

   the lab is interested in molecular mechanisms of how neurons are born,
   how they extend axons, and how they regenerate or fail to regenerate
   after mammalian cns injury. we use in vivo axon injury models, neuronal
   cultures, molecular biology, and various imaging and tissue engineering
   techniques to study classic and identify novel signaling pathways and
   epigenetic mechanisms that promote neurogenesis and axonogenesis. such
   knowledge is crucial for targeting molecules for effective cns
   regeneration. similar mechanisms also have relevance in cns tumor
   biology. discovering the molecular driving forces of tumor stem cell
   migration, proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal will point
   to novel therapeutic approaches.
   emotional experiences leave an enduring record in the brain by way of
   structural and molecular remodeling of cells and synapses.  while these
   modifications help organisms respond appropriately to threats and
   rewards, they also contribute to maladaptive states like addiction and
   post-traumatic stress disorder.  many key characteristics of emotional
   memory mirror those of synaptic plasticity in reduced neuronal
   preparations.  for example, both involve changes in neurotransmission
   that can persist for long periods provided they undergo molecular
   stabilization.  we now recognize, however, that this basic model fails
   to capture the complexity of processes that contribute to emotional
   memory storage, or that update or inhibit memory as behavioral
   conditions change.
   we utilize molecular and electrophysiological approaches, including
   optogenetic stimulation, to identify how associative fear conditioning
   modifies neural pathways and individual neurons in limbic and cortical
   brain regions.  once fear responses are established, other experiments
   address the mechanisms that contribute to their long-term maintenance,
   as well as their reinforcement or attenuation by molecular and
   behavioral interventions.
   work in my lab is focused on how experience alters the function of
   brain circuits to encode emotional responses.

   in parallel studies, we have recently discovered that the large family
   of potassium channel proteins, that include the g protein-sensitive
   channels, function by direct interactions with phosphatidylinositol
   phospholipids in the plasma membrane. g protein signaling is likely to
   activate these channels conformationally by adjusting channel
   phospholipid interactions. moreover, signaling pathways that regulate
   the level of these phospholipids critically affect the function of
   these potassium channels. \r\n\r\n\r\n
   cardiac and neuronal cells of the central nervous system, where these
   channels are prevalent, are isolated from heart and brain and are
   studied electrophysiologically. transgenic models with defects in g
   proteins or the potassium channel are used to elucidate the functional
   importance of these molecules in the particular tissue and the whole
   organism. \r\n\r\n\r\n
   the lab employs electrophysiological techniques to assay ion channel
   function (patch clamp, two-electrode voltage clamp). molecular
   biological techniques are used to clone and perform structure-function
   studies on these potassium channels. expression of recombinant channels
   in xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines are used routinely towards
   mechanistic studies. cell isolation methods and tissue culture
   techniques are also routinely used. confocal microscopy is used to
   localize the channel proteins in cells and tissues. \r\n\r\n

   dr. e. premkumar reddy obtained his ph.d. in 1971 and carried out his
   post-doctoral training at the ucla school of medicine from 1972-1974
   and later at the national cancer institute from 1974-75.   he worked at
   the national cancer institute first as an independent investigator and
   later as a section chief between 1975 and 1984.  in 1984, he moved to
   hoffmann la roche and held appointments at hoffmann la roche and the
   roche institute of molecular biology as a full member.  in 1986, he
   joined the wistar institute as a professor and deputy director.  from
   1992 to 2010, he served as the director of the fels institute for
   cancer research and molecular biology, temple university school of
   medicine, philadelphia. he joined the mount sinai school of medicine in
   march of 2010 as a professor in the departments of oncological sciences
   and the department of structural and chemical biology and as the
   director of experimental cancer therapeutics.
   while working at the national cancer institute, he made a number of
   seminal discoveries that provided a clear understanding of the
   molecular basis of cancer.  he cloned and sequenced a number of viral
   oncogenes which included abl, ras, fgr, mos, myb, myc and sis oncogenes
   and their cellular homologues which pinpointed the precise changes that
   cellular proto-oncogenes undergo to produce cancer-causing viral
   oncogenes.   he extended this work to human cancers and was responsible
   for the seminal discovery that point mutations in the cellular ras
   genes result in their oncogenic activation.  his work also showed the
   mechanisms associated with the activation of abl and myb oncogenes,
   which are associated with the development of human myelogenous
   leukemias. his recent work on cell cycle regulator, cdk4 has shown that
   this gene is very critical for the development of erbb2 and ras
   oncogene-induced tumors and inhibition of expression of cdk4 causes
   ablation of breast cancers caused by erbb2 and ras oncogenes.
   dr. reddy has pioneered the development of small molecule inhibitors
   targeted against oncogenes and cell cycle regulators for cancer
   therapy.  one of the drugs developed by dr. reddy, on01910 is currently
   in phase iii clinical trials and has shown profound clinical activity
   in mds (myelodysplastic syndrome) patients as a single agent.  in
   combination with oxaliplatin and gemcitabine, on01910 was found to have
   remarkable efficacy in reducing the tumor burden of several metastatic
   cancers including breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers.   in addition
   to on01910, dr. reddy has developed six different cancer drugs, two of
   which (on013100, and on01210) have entered clinical trials and the
   other three are expected to enter clinical trials in the next one
   year.  two of these drugs, a small molecule inhibitor of plk2,
   on1231320 and a second compounds on123300 which is a dual inhibitor of
   cdk4 and akt pathways are currently undergoing pre-clinical evaluation.
   dr. reddy  founded the cancer journal oncogene in 1986 and served as
   its editor from 1986 to 2009.  in 2010, he founded a second cancer
   journal, genes & cancer for which he currently serves as the
   editor-in-chief.

   my research interests are at the interface of chemistry and biology.
   specifically my lab develops and uses optical probes, called "caged
   compounds", to understand fundamental principles in cellular
   physiology. i have worked in this field since my post-doctoral studies
   at the university of pennsylvania in the late 1980s. during that time i
   published two seminal papers developing the most widely used caged
   calcium probes (pnas 1988, 1994). these light-sensitive reagents have
   been the basis of 100s of biological studies in many disciples. since
   1995 i have had an independent lab that has been continuously funded by
   the us national institutes of health. during this period the focus of
   my research has been developing and using tools for two-photon
   microscopy. in 2001 we published a seminal paper in this field, which
   was the first example of optical stimulation of visually designated
   single synapses (nature neuroscience). this work proved the foundation
   for work by many neuroscience labs around the world. my recent research
   at mount sinai has involved developing new probes that allow
   chromatically selective, multi-color uncaging. with this work we have
   taken optical stimulation of cells out of the "monochrome era" so as to
   enable bi-directional control of neuronal signaling with different
   colors of light for the first time.
   in the past 30 years the use of fluorescence imaging in biological
   sciences has been as important as dna-based methods advancing our
   understanding in almost every field. (nobel prizes for gfp (2008) and
   super resolution imaging (2014) are testament to this.) my work during
   this period has pioneered the use of light to control cell function,
   the optical tools we have made have proved to be conceptual fundamental
   enabling technologies. the goal of my current and future work is to be
   equally transformative.
   my lab uses organic chemistry to develop new optical methods for cell
   physiology.

   in the faith lab in the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai, we are
   developing and applying experimental and computational tools to
   understand the interactions between diet, the microbiota, and human
   health (with an emphasis on inflammatory bowel disease).
   areas of interest to the laboratory include the manipulation of the gut
   microbiota and microbiome, the stability and inheritance of the
   microbiota, the interactions between our gut microbes and our immune
   system, and the development of new computational and experimental
   technologies to better model and assay the interactions between our gut
   microbes and our health.

   model of the bulky analog n6-(benzyl)-adp docked in the expanded active
   site of analog-sensitive (as) mutant human cdk2
   a network in control of cell division and gene expression
   how do cells decide when to divide and, having committed to that fate,
   how do they faithfully duplicate and segregate their contentsâincluding
   their dna? among the progeny of these divisions, which all carry the
   same genetic information, how are different programs of gene expression
   established and maintained? our lab studies the regulation of both
   processesâcell division and gene expressionâby a network of
   cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). we take a chemical genetic approach,
   by expanding the atp-binding pocket of a targeted cdk to accommodate
   bulky atp analogsâboth inhibitors and substratesâthat cannot bind to
   the wild-type kinase (figure). in multicellular organisms, cell-cycle
   and transcriptional cdk networks are linked by cdk7, the cdk-activating
   kinase (cak), which is also part of the general transcription factor
   tfiih. we determined how cdk7 coordinates its cell-cycle function with
   a second essential function during the transcription cycle of rna
   polymerase (rnap) ii. our studies reveal similarities of organization
   cycles, in which checkpoints and surveillance systems enforce fidelity,
   directionality and irreversibility. by chemical genetic analysis of the
   cdk network we hope to define the precise roles and targets of specific
   cdk-cyclin complexes in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulation, and
   to identify potential vulnerabilities of cancer cells to specific cdk
   inhibitors.

   our research is directed towards the study of selective neuronal
   vulnerability in dementing illnesses using classical neuropathological
   as well as modern quantitative immunohistochemical methods. we intend
   to develop a quantitative, detailed and cohesive definition of neuronal
   susceptibility to degeneration in the cerebral cortex, by extending
   data on alzheimer disease to other dementing disorders as well as
   animal models of age-related illnesses, and by defining the key
   neurochemical and morphological characteristics linked to relative
   vulnerability (or resistance to degeneration) of identified neuronal
   populations. the regional and laminar distribution in the cerebral
   cortex of specific neuronal populations is investigated in a variety of
   neurodegenerative disorders, and quantitatively compared to alzheimer
   disease and control brains. in addition, a detailed study of brains
   from aged patients with no records of neurological and psychiatric
   disorders is performed in order to define further the limits of normal
   aging in the brain.
   we employ advanced microscopy, high field magnetic resonance imaging,
   stereologic, and modeling approaches to develop an accurate
   quantitative assessment of such pathological changes in a region- and
   layer-specific manner. neuronal morphology is analyzed in a
   quantitative manner using intracellular injection of hippocampal and
   neocortical neurons coupled with computerized reconstruction to assess
   the degree to which the accumulation of pathologic markers causes
   dendritic atrophy and spine loss in different subtypes of neocortical
   pyramidal cells subserving cortical circuits critical for memory and
   cognition. the characterization of such vulnerable neurons and circuits
   is fundamental to the design of therapeutic strategies aiming at their
   protection or rescue. similar approaches are applied to the
   neuropathology of schizophrenia and autism.
   finally we are investigating mammalian brain evolution with a focus on
   cetaceans and great apes. these studies have led us to identify
   specific neuronal types in parts of the cerebral cortex known to be
   involved in social awareness, judgment, and attention that can be
   considered as markers of adaptive mechanisms and functions in response
   to particular ecological pressure.

   synapse structure and function is continuously modified during
   development and throughout life by experience, such as learning new
   skills or forming new memories. such synaptic plasticity is thus
   critical for normal brain function. synaptic plasticity can also become
   maladaptive under conditions of brain, spinal or peripheral nerve
   injury, leading to abnormal function or sensation. dr. huntley's
   research focuses on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity through which
   synaptic structure and function are modified by experience or injury.
   research projects include: 1) the role of the cadherin family of
   synaptic adhesion proteins in synapse and circuit development,
   3) molecules and mechanisms regulating aberrant corticostriatal circuit
   development and plasticity in autism and parkinson's disease models.

   the explosion of large-scale, high-throughput technologies in the
   biological sciences demands a comprehensive view of biological
   systems.   dr. zhu's research focuses on:
   1.     method development in integrating diverse high-throughput data
   into probabilistic causal network models.  there are multiple risk
   factors as well as their interactions contributing to complex human
   diseases, such genetic background, infection, environmental states,
   life-style choices, and etc.   it is critical to integrate all these
   factors into comprehensive disease networks which provide a context to
   understand mechanism of diseases and to study effects of genetic
   perturbations, drug perturbations, and their interactions.  dr. zhu's
   group has developed many methods for integrating genetic and genomic
   data into bayesian networks:
   2.     method development in comparing multiple networks.  there are
   multiple risk/perturbation factors driving a biological system from a
   healthy state to a disease state.  in response, there are hundreds to
   thousands genes changed at transcription or protein levels.  dr. zhu's
   works showed that instead of monitoring changes in a few genes, it is
   more robust to monitor changes of network states or structures when
   studying complex diseases:
   3.     method development in analyzing biological networks.  if
   comprehensive biological networks are available, how to convert network
   knowledge into actionable items?  for example in drug discovery and
   development, we investigated which nodes and node combinations in the
   networks can generate largest beneficial effects when perturbed.  in
   biomarker research, we examined which parts of networks can robustly
   connect to drug response, disease progression and survivals.

   we explore information processing in the nervous system, and use the
   visual system as a convenient model. we employ systems analysis,
   borrowed from communication engineering, as the conceptual and
   methodological framework. we use single and multi-neuron recordings and
   optical imaging of neuronal activity, and have developed sophisticated
   techniques for stimulation of the visual system, and for the analysis
   of neuronal responses to these stimuli. we also record simultaneously
   the input and output of neurons in the visual thalamic nucleus, the
   lateral geniculate nucleus (lgn), in order to learn how information
   transmission from the retina to the visual cortex through the lgn is
   controlled. applied mathematics and computers are used extensively for
   stimulation, analysis and modeling of the systems under study.
    currently we are investigating the properties of visual neurons in the
   retina, lgn and visual cortex of monkeys and cats, with an emphasis on
   the temporal, spatial and chromatic selectivities of these cells, and
   on the nature, source and function of the variability (noise) of
   neuronal responses. since perception and behavior involve the
   coordinated activity of many interacting neurons, we also use optical
   imaging to visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of activity in
   neuronal ensembles in the visual cortex. in addition, we are recording
   from groups of neurons in the lgn and visual cortex, and study their
   dynamical interractions and the information that these neuronal
   ensembles carry. the experimental approaches are augmented by
   computational modeling of lgn neurons and cortical circuits. the topics
   we are focused on currently include: the representation of color in the
   primate visual cortex, the transmission of information from retina to
   cortex via the lgn, and the role of the descending pathways in the
   brain.
    recently we have started to record from populations of neurons in the
   brains of mice, from regions involved in depression, drug addiction and
   post-traumatic-stress-disorder (ptsd). the recorded regions incluide
   the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (vta). we subject
   the recordings to various mathematical methods that quantify the
   population behavior, in order to determine whether pathological
   behavior is reflected in the network behavior.
   our research is supported by grants from the nih's eye institute,
   institute for general medical sciences, and the institute for
   mathematical & biological synthesis.
    our research focuses on the analysis of human genetic variation to
   address fundamental questions in biology, medicine and anthropology. we
   are interested in detecting patterns of demography in genomic data to
   inform our inference of human evolution and history, and result in
   better outcomes for medical genomics. we combine population genetics
   theory, complex disease mapping, statistical modeling and
   experimentation to gain a deeper understanding of the landscape of
   genetic variation in global populations and its impact on function,
   fitness and adaptation. a detailed description of current projects can
   be found here.

   research focus
   epigenetic regulation in stem cells and human diseases.
   â â â  our research is focused on genomic imprinting. we are analyzing
   the acquisition and maintenance of genomic dna methylation imprints in
   mouse as well as in es and ips cells. we are also applying our zfp57
   knockout mouse to modeling of imprinting related complex human diseases
   such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
   genomic imprinting in stem cells
   â â â  genomic imprinting is essential for mammalian development.
   consistent with this, a majority of cloned embryos die in utero, mainly
   from the failure to re-establish proper genomic imprints. cell-based
   therapies offer great hopes for various degenerative diseases,
   including alzheimerâs disease and diabetes. embryonic stem (es) cells
   derived from nuclear transfer experiments and induced pluripotent stem
   (ips) cells reprogrammed from adult cells are candidates for this
   therapeutic approach. however, they all have genomic imprinting defects
   which can inhibit differentiation and may even cause cancer. recently,
   it was reported that dysregulation of the dlk1-dio3 imprinted domain is
   the only notable difference between es cells and ips cells (stadtfeld,
   m. et al. nature, 2010). indeed, hypermethylation and aberrant
   expression of the imprinted genes were observed at the dlk1-dio3
   imprinted region in ips cells therefore, it is important to know how to
   manipulate the genomic imprinting machinery in pluripotent stem cells
   including ips and ntes cells so that proper development of different
   lineages of cells can be achieved for therapeutic applications.â
   â â â  the current major focus of our lab is to analyze acquisition and
   maintenance of genomic imprinting in stem cells as well as in mouse
   embryos. recently, we discovered that zfp57 is highly enriched in es
   cells and is a key regulator in genomic imprinting at multiple
   imprinted regions including the dlk1-dio3 domain. loss of zfp57 results
   in loss of dna methylation genomic imprints at these imprinted regions.
   consistent with our finding, mutations in human zfp57 result in
   hypomethylation at multiple imprinted regions. currently we are
   actively investigating the underlying mechanisms of zfp57-associated
   complexes in the acquisition and maintenance of dna methylation
   imprints in both mouse embryos and es cells.
   mechanisms in genomic imprinting
   â â â  despite that genomic imprinting was identified in mammals almost
   three decades ago, many unanswered questions persist about the nature
   of genomic imprinting memory and about how genomic imprints are
   established and maintained. zfp57 has both maternal and zygotic
   functions and it exhibits maternal-zygotic embryonic lethality, the
   first one identified in mammals. zfp57 maintains both paternal and
   maternal genomic imprints and may target dna methyltransferases to the
   imprinting control regions (icr). interestingly, these germline-derived
   differential dna methylation imprints at the icrs can be lost in
   embryos in the absence of both maternal and zygotic zfp57 and they can
   be acquired in mouse embryos in the presence of zygotic zfp57 even
   though they are not established in the germline. moreover, acquisition
   of dna methylation in mouse embryos occurs in an allele-specific
   fashion, suggesting the presence of dna methylation-independent
   heritable imprinting memory such as heritable histone modifications.
   therefore, further functional analysis of zfp57 in genomic imprinting
   will help us to achieve a better understanding of the molecular nature
   of imprinting memory as well as the temporal and developmental control
   of dna methylation imprints.
   modeling complex human diseases
   â â â  dysregulation of imprinting genes can lead to cancer,
   neurological diseases, diabetes and other kinds of human diseases.
   indeed, mutations in human zfp57 are associated with transient neonatal
   diabetes, congenital heart defects and abnormal development of the
   nervous system. we have independently discovered that zfp57 mutant
   mouse is obese and display similar defects in the cardiovascular
   system. thus, our zfp57 mutant mouse could serve as useful animal
   models for complex human diseases such as obesity, diabetes and
   cardiovascular diseases.
   figure 1.â  rna in-situ hybridization reveals that zfp57 is expressed
   specifically in the oocytes (purple stain) within the follicles.
   .
   figure 2.â zfp57 is involved in the acquisition, maintenance and
   re-acquisition of dna methylation genomic imprints. paternal
   chromosomes are indicated by blue lines. ig, ig-dmr. sn, snrpn dmr.

   embryo. -/+, a heterozygous zfp57 embryo derived from a null female.
   differential dna methylation at the cpg sites of imprinting control
   regions (icr) is reset during gametogenesis. in sperm, the cpg sites at
   the ig-dmr (ig) of the dlk1-dio3 imprinted domain are methylated while
   those at the snrpn dmr (sn) are unmethylated. by contrast, methylation
   occurs at the snrpn dmr but not at the ig-dmr in the ooytes derived
   from wild-type females. upon fertilization, differential methylation is
   reconstituted at the icrs in the wild-type zygote (zygote (1)). these
   germline-derived differential dna methylation imprints are resistant to
   genome-wide pronuclear demethylation in the zygote and stably
   maintained in wild-type embryos. without zygotic zfp57, differential
   dna methylation is partially lost in the zygotic mutant embryos around
   mid-gestation (midgestation embryo (a)). when both maternal and zygotic
   zfp57 are absent, differential dna methylation is completely missing in
   the mid-gestation maternal-zygotic mutant embryos (midgestation embryo
   (b)). without maternal zfp57, dna methylation is not established at the
   cpg sites of the snrpn dmr in the oocytes derived from zfp57 homozygous
   female mice. in pre-implantation embryos lacking maternal zfp57 (zygote
   (2)), differential dna methylation at the snrpn dmr remains absent.
   intriguingly, differential dna methylation is re-acquired
   allele-specifically at the maternal chromosome of the snrpn dmr in the
   presence of the zygotic zfp57 in about 50% of the heterozygous embryos
   derived from null female mice (li et al., 2008).

   â â â the focus of our research is to understand the molecular and
   cellular nature of the undifferentiated stem cell "states", and how
   such states are altered during a change in cell fate. the underlying
   rationale for our studies is that the complement of gene-products and
   their inter-relationships that exist in stem cells accounts for their
   remarkable abilities to balance self-renewal and differentiation
   decision processes. we study both adult and embryonic stem (es) cells,
   primarily from the mouse, but also from the human. as a first step, we
   have comprehensively identified most, if not all gene-products that are
   expressed in highly purified hematopoietic stem cell (hsc). we
   performed similar analyses in mouse es cells. such molecular
   "signatures" provide parts-lists that are available to the stem cells.
   the challenge has been to functionally address the roles that these
   molecules play in mediating the biological properties of hsc and es
   cells. further, we would like to understand how these molecular
   components are "wired" into regulatory signaling and transcriptional
   networks.
   â â â to explore these issues we have utilized a number of global
   gene-expression perturbation technologies, such as inhibitory short
   hairpin rna (shrna). we have successfully down regulated the expression
   levels of candidate regulatory molecules in both hsc and es cells. a
   number of these play crucial regulatory roles in processes such as
   self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. we have further
   developed strategies that allow the analyses of cell-fate change
   dynamics at multiple biochemical and molecular levels in response to
   defined and precisely controlled changes in the expression levels of
   key regulatory molecules. these strategies have provided the first
   in-depth view of how a cell-fate decision actually occurs at the
   transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and
   post-translational levels. an important aspect of our overall efforts
   is computational and quantitative analyses. we anticipate that our
   approach will yield a systems biology level description and
   understanding of stem cell decision processes. this in turn, will have
   profound implications in future efforts focused on applying basic stem
   cell research in translational as well as clinical contexts.

   â â â â â â my research is focused on defining the cellular and
   molecular nature of hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) and the molecular
   cross-talk that occurs between stem cells and their niche. we use
   transgenic mouse models to study hsc during normal homeostasis and
   after stress. we are interested in the basic property of self-renewal
   and whether hscs really do self-renew to full functional potential when
   they undergo cell division. the lab is also using specific factors to
   directly induce hemogenesis from somatic cells, both mouse and human.
   we have shown that the induction process recapitulates developmental
   hematopoies and molecular cues from these studies have led to a new
   investigation of hsc precursor populations during embryonic
   development. overall our studies will have broad implications on the
   behavior of all stem cells including those that contribute to
   metastatic cancer and leukemias.â

   summary of research studies:
   perhaps the most fundamental process in biology is that by which one
   cell becomes two. our research focuses on two related aspects of the
   biology that controls the integrity of the genome.
   1. we study the control of the cell division cycle, and the signaling
   pathways (checkpoints) that respond to chromosomal damage and prevent
   cell cycle progression until that damage is repaired.
   dna damage checkpoints function throughout the cell cycle. those
   working in g1 phase to prevent the replication of damaged dna are
   almost invariably mutated or inactivated in cancers. these defects
   contribute not only to the instability of tumor cell genomes, but can
   also knock-out pro-apoptotic pathways, rendering tumors resistant to
   treatment. those functioning in g2 phase to prevent commitment to
   mitosis are, however, virtually always intact and appear to be required
   for the viability of tumor cells that lack g1 checkpoints. our research
   is geared to dissect the molecular and cell biology of g2 checkpoints,
   and aims to use this knowledge in the design and testing of targeted
   anti-cancer therapies. taking genetic and genomic approaches, we
   utilize fission yeast as a gene and pathway discovery tool, and then
   apply this information to studies in human cells. we are currently
   focusing our efforts into: (1) the regulation and function of a
   checkpoint effector protein kinase, chk1, informing its suitability as
   modify lesions in dna into structures that signal the checkpoint and
   can be repaired.
   2. we are investigating how determinants of chromosome structure
   regulate chromosome segregation and dna repair, with an emphasis on
   events that occur during dna replication.
   chromosomes are highly dynamic structures. they undergo massive
   reorganization to enable dna replication and chromosome segregation to
   occur. this is under the control of the dna topoisomerases, and three
   related and interacting structural maintenance of chromosomes (smc)
   complexes known as cohesin, condensin and the smc5/6 complex. defects
   in the processes controlled by these enzymes are a potent inducer of
   chromosome segregation defects leading to changes in chromosome number
   (aneuploidy). their function during dna replication appears to be
   particularly important, where they control recombination to ensure a
   complete round of replication by overcoming obstacles that block
   polymerases, which is then followed by chromosome reorganization in
   preparation for mitosis.  with the importance of replication fidelity,
   cells have back-up mechanisms controlled by a multi-brct domain protein
   (brc1/ptip) and the post-replication repair (prr) machinery. we are
   focusing our efforts to understanding how these various genome
   integrity determinants are integrated in time and space to ensure
   accurate replication and division of the genome.

   the main research interest of my laboratory is in understanding the
   mechanisms of cancer metastasis via the lymphatic system and the
   function of lymphatic vessels in the regulation of immune response.
   metastasis is the main cause of treatment failure and death for cancer
   patients. the first site to which cancer cells metastasize are lymph
   nodes, and the extent of lymph node involvement is a major criterion
   for evaluating patient prognosis and the choice of therapy. despite the
   fact that the importance of the lymphatic system as a pathway for
   cancer metastasis has been well recognized, research efforts over the
   past decades have been focused primarily on understanding the
   mechanisms of tumor spread via the blood vasculature. thus, the
   mechanisms of tumor spread via the lymphatic system remain poorly
   understood. aside from serving as a transport system for tumor cells,
   the lymphatic system normally collects extravasated fluid,
   macromolecules and leukocytes from tissues and returns them to the
   blood circulation. by directing antigen-presenting cells, t-cells and
   antigens from peripheral tissues into the lymph nodes, lymphatic
   vessels play an important role in the initiation of immune response.
   however, the mechanisms by which leukocytes are mobilized into the
   lymphatic vessels are poorly understood, and in particular, the role of
   lymphatic vessels in the process remains unknown.
   our long-term research efforts are dedicated towards elucidating the
   molecular mechanisms which regulate lymphatic vessel growth (i.e.
   lymphangiogenesis) and the function of lymphatic vessels in cancer and
   in normal physiology. current research includes investigations of the
   mechanisms by which tumor cells interact with the lymphatic vasculature
   during early steps of metastasis. we are investigating the role of role
   of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules expressed by the lymphatic
   endothelium in tumor invasion and metastasis, to gain insight into the
   mechanisms which regulate tumor cell migration and entry into the
   lymphatic vessels. we are also investigating the molecular mechanisms
   of lymphangiogenesis. our previous studies have demonstrated that the
   induction of tumor lymphangiogenesis by the vascular endothelial growth
   factor-c (vegf-c) facilitates tumor metastases. the goals of our
   current research activities are to better understand the mechanisms by
   which vegf-c promotes metastasis and to assess the potential of vegf-c
   and its receptors as targets for the anti-metastatic therapy. our
   efforts are also dedicated towards identification of novel
   lymphangiogenic factors and markers of the lymphatic endothelium.
   finally, the lab is exploring the role of lymphatic vasculature in the
   regulation of immune response, particularly its function in regulating
   migration and activation of antigen-presenting cells. the ultimate goal
   of these studies is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by
   which lymphatic endothelial cells control physiological cell migration
   and to examine whether tumor cells take advantage of these mechanisms
   to gain access to the lymphatic vessels. the knowledge gained with the
   above studies may provide a foundation for the development of new
   therapeutic approaches to predict, arrest and treat cancer metastases.

   research in my laboratory centers on developing computational
   techniques for the modeling and understanding of complex molecular
   systems such as proteins and nucleic acids in their aqueous
   environments. the methods developed are applied to problems of interest
   in structural biology. methodological developments focus on novel

   extending the range of applicability of grand-canonical ensemble
   simulations, on enhancing monte carlo sampling algorithms and on
   developing novel approaches to the analysis and visualization of
   macromolecular structures and computer simulation results. these
   techniques are applied to the calculation of the solvent contribution
   to conformational free energy differences between various conformation
   lipid bilayers. in addition, ligand-protein interactions are studied by
   docking tecniques and by molecular dynamics. recent work showed that
   grand-canonical ensemble simulations can be used to predict sites for

   what causes aging and age-related diseases, especially obesity,
   diabetes, and alzheimer's disease?
   the metabolic mystery: obesity and diabetes (a surfeit of nutritional
   resources) accelerate many age-related diseases, and dietary
   restriction (a dearthof nutritional resources) slows down aging itself
   and almost all age-related diseases. what's up with that?
   can we develop a drug to mimic all the protective effects of dietary
   restriction? (yes!)
   our laboratory uses histological, behavioral, electrophysiological, and
   molecular, methods (including dna microarrays and rna interference) to
   assess the basic mechanisms by which hypothalamic neurons sense and
   regulate metabolic state (including body weight and food intake), and
   how these mechanisms are impaired in metabolic diseases and during
   aging. a driving question of our laboratory is what may be called the
   metabolic mystery. this refers to the fascinating phenomenon that
   obesity is a risk factor for most age-related diseases and indeed for
   mortality, and conversely dietary restriction appears to slow down the
   aging process and extend maximum lifespan. considering that almost all
   major pathologies are influenced by caloric intake, the mechanisms
   underlying the metabolic mystery may be considered among the most
   compelling in biomedical science. we really don't understand why
   caloric intake should lead to diseases, but many lines of evidence
   suggest neuroendocrine mechanisms. we have begun to study the nature of
   the hypothalamic neurons which are sensitive to nutrition and which in
   turn regulate metabolic state, and we have thus begun to define a
   "nutritional field" of neurons which contain overlapping domains
   sensitive to different nutrients and which regulate different aspects
   of metabolism. of particular interest is that the maximum overlap of
   these nutritional stimulation (e.g., glucose and leptin) may occur
   within the pomc neurons, which we now believe play a critical role in
   regulating metabolism. this is particularly interesting because the
   pomc neurons are among the most sensitive to decline during aging. to
   begin to directly test the role of specific gene products in the
   development of obesity, diabetes, and aging, we have now produced
   several lines of transgenic mice that overexpress leptin, pomc,
   insulin, and glucokinase specifically in the brain, and we are now
   assessing the effects of these transgenes in obesity, diabetes, and
   aging. for example, we have now shown that transgenic enhancement of
   neuronal pomc will completely correct the diabetes and other
   impairments in genetically obese mice. these studies have led to
   discovery of a new class of anti-obesity drugs that we are now
   studying. a new direction in our laboratory involves examining function
   of metabolic genes we have discovered using microarrays using rna
   interference protocols in mice and in c. elegans. using high-throughput
   rnai screening methods we have discovered over 20 novel genes that
   regulate obesity in c. elegans. using a similar approach we have also
   discovered a transcriptional complex that mediates the protective
   effects of dietary restriction to increase lifespan and protect against
   age-related diseases, including alzheimer-type pathology and diabetic
   complications. pharmacological activation of this pathway increases
   lifespan and protects against neurodegenerative diseases, and the same
   complex predicts lifespan and obesity in mice. we have now also
   developed novel high-throughput methods to discover novel anti-obesity
   and anti-diabetes drugs, and have discovered over 20 drugs in each
   class so far.
   what is the hypothesis?
   a key observation about the nature of age-related impairments is that
   these impairments accrue over time, reflecting a cumulative and
   apparently irreversible process. we have now discovered the molecular
   mechanism of this "molecular memory" effect and shown that it applies
   to all age-related diseases that are influenced by dietary restriction.
   in particular this process explains the cumulative development of
   diabetic complications, and implies that both age-related impairments
   and diabetic complications can not only be slowed (as with dietary
   restriction) but can actually be reveresed, by blocking glucose
   metabolism more effectively than can be done with dietary restriction.

   we work on synaptic plasticity, the aging brain, and the synaptic basis
   of age-related cognitive decline. we are particularly interested in the
   distinction between alzheimer's disease (ad) and the more modest
   disruption of memory often referred to as age-associated cognitive
   impairment or mild cognitive impairment (mci) that often occurs in the
   context of normal aging. while age-associated cognitive impairment
   represents a major health problem on its own that must be solved,
   preventing the transition from mci to ad is a related goal of enormous
   importance given the rising threat and cost of ad to western society.
   in order to achieve either goal, we need to understand the cellular,
   synaptic, and molecular basis of the earliest age-related alterations
   that lead to cognitive decline and how these events relate to the
   complex physiology of aging, such as the aging of endocrine systems
   that affect the brain, or the interactions between stress and aging.
   for example, in ad, the cortical neurons that provide the complex
   connections that mediate cognition degenerate, leading to the
   catastrophic loss of cognitive function evident in dementia. unlike ad,
   significant neuron death does not occur in normal aging and thus does
   not appear to be the cause of the initial stages of age-associated
   cognitive impairment. while these circuits do not die in normal aging,
   we have shown that they are vulnerable to sub-lethal age-related
   alterations in structure, synaptic integrity, and molecular processing
   at the synapse, all of which impair cognitive function in
   well-characterized animal models. in addition, while synapse loss
   occurs in aging, all synapses are not equally vulnerable and all
   regions do not age the same way. our recent data on prefrontal cortex
   show that there is a selective loss of the class of synapses that is
   most plastic and likely to play a critical role in the cognitive
   processes mediated by prefrontal cortex, yet the age-related synaptic
   alterations in hippocampus are quite different, with minimal synapse
   loss. biochemical alterations of the synapse, such as shifts in
   distribution or abundance of key neurotransmitter receptors, may also
   contribute to memory impairment, particularly in hippocampus.
   we have shown that the same brain regions and circuits vulnerable to
   aging are responsive to circulating estrogen levels, suggesting that
   critical interactions between reproductive senescence and brain aging
   may affect excitatory synaptic transmission and cognitive performance.
   in fact, estrogen treatment in aged female monkeys protected the
   vulnerable class of synapses and restored cognitive performance to that
   of young monkeys. importantly, the effects of estrogen on these neurons
   show that certain age-associated synaptic alterations may be
   reversible, leading to the protection of cognitive performance observed
   in these monkeys. these effects of estrogen give us a molecular and
   therapeutic entry point to explore additional interventions and
   strategies to protect against synaptic aging. if we can prevent the
   synaptic aging of these circuits while still largely intact, we may be
   able to protect individuals against the earliest stages of cognitive
   decline and in turn, prevent the transition to the death of these
   circuits that underlies ad.
   a parallel area of research in our lab investigates the effects of
   behavioral stress on neurons in the prefrontal cortex. we have shown
   that stress leads to dendritic retraction on pyramidal neurons in
   prefrontal cortex, and this leads to cognitive decline. importantly, if
   stress is discontinued these neurons recover, both structurally and
   functionally. in addition, the specific neuronal responses to stress
   differ between males and females. all of these studies were done in
   young animals, but recently, we were able to link our investigations
   into neuronal aging with our interest in behaviorally (i.e., stress)-
   induced plasticity. while the dendrites of prefrontal neurons in young
   animals recover from stress-induced retraction, this capacity for
   recovery is absent in middle-aged and aged animals. furthermore,
   prefrontal neurons in middle-aged and aged rats lose spines with aging
   in the absence of stress and are further stress-induced synaptic loss
   or plasticity.  we are now pursuing the mechanisms responsible for
   age-related loss of experience dependent plasticity.

   dr. zhang's multiscale network modeling laboratory (mnml) is focused on
   construction and characterization of multiscale biological networks
   from large-scale genomic, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic and clinical
   data. the fundamental goal of mnml's research is to not only identify
   novel pathways and driver genes for complex human diseases but also
   build up biologically plausible mechanistic models of diseases for
   subsequent experimental and clinical validations. mnml has developed
   and significantly contributed a series of influential gene network
   inference algorithms that have been extensively used for identification
   of novel pathways and gene targets, as well as development of drugs for
   complex human diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, alzheimer's,
   obesity and diabetes. mnml's latest research that uncovered dramatic
   changes in gene-gene interaction patterns in alzheimer's disease and
   pinpointed an immune/microglia gene network as the top pathway causally
   linked to the disease was just published in cell. dr. zhang's recent
   research that sheds a new light on targeted therapies against breast
   cancer was featured in a press release by the aacr basic cancer
   research conference in 2011. dr. zhang's work on predicting genetic
   interactions was identified by nature biotechnology as one of the
   breakthroughs in the field of computational biology in 2010. the
   discovery of a gene cluster that is causally linked to obesity and
   diabetes was highlighted in nature in 2008.

   the goal of our research is to better understand the molecular
   mechanisms of addiction and depression. we use animal models of these
   disorders to identify the ways in which long-term exposure to drugs of
   abuse or stress changes the brain to lead to addiction- or
   depression-like syndromes. a major focus of our work is on drug- and
   stress-induced changes in gene expression and chromatin structure
   within the brain's reward circuitry.
    we use human pluripotent stem cells to understand the mechanisms of
   malignant and non-malignant genetic blood diseases and to develop new
   therapies. we are harnessing somatic cell reprogramming and genetic
   engineering technologies to develop new models of normal and abnormal
   hematopoiesis. by capturing and introducing disease-associated genetic
   mutations and large chromosomal deletions in patient-derived induced
   pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) we study their phenotypic and functional
   consequences, attempt to reconstruct the genetic history of leukemia
   progression and seek to identify new therapeutic targets through
   genetic and chemical screens.

   even though individually rare, developmental disorders are common as a
   group: about 1 in 6 children in the u.s. were reported as having a
   developmental disability in the screening period of 2006-2008 (please
   visit the website of the centers for disease control and prevention).
   the neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds) we study include autism
   spectrum disorders (asd), intellectual disability (id) and epilepsy.
   we are dedicated to understanding the relationship between a personâs
   genes and neurodevelopmental disorders in order to help patients and
   families.
   understanding the causes of these disorders may in the future improve
   the ability to diagnose and treat children with neurodevelopmental
   disorders.
   autism spectrum disorders (asd) â autism spectrum disorders impact a
   childâs development in a number of ways: limited or unusual language
   and speech development limited or impaired social skills, and the
   presence of ritualistic or repetitive behaviors that often limit
   typical social development.
   intellectual disability (id) â intellectual disability is characterized
   by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in
   adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical
   skills, starting before 18 years old.
   epilepsy â 20 to 35 % of children with autism have seizures or develop
   epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. in turn, individuals with
   new-onset epilepsy can experience developmental and cognitive delays.
   these conditions frequently overlap with one another, in addition to
   other ndds and sometimes physical anomalies. there is very strong
   evidence that the same genetic variants can contribute to all three
   conditions, asd, id, and epilepsy. patients with different clinical
   presentations within the ndds spectrum can have mutations in the same
   gene, or in the same region that controls gene function. although
   several genes have been identified for autism, and to a lesser extent
   for epilepsy, the etiology remains unknown in most affected
   individuals.
   we are interested in understanding how genetic changes can lead to the
   emergence and co-ocurrence of various ndds. with a better understanding
   of the biological basis of ndds, scientists and doctors can hope to
   bring families and patients more personalized care and effective
   treatment in the future.
   neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds), such as developmental delay,
   autism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability are frequent in children
   and can have a genetic basis.
   we are interested in learning how genetic changes can affect brain
   development, and, subsequently, lead to disease. this study will
   examine similarities and differences in the genes of people with ndds
   and their family members.
   ndds can co-occur in the same family or the same person, suggesting
   that they may be caused by similar or related genetic changes. by
   mapping both shared and distinct changes we will better understand the
   biological basis of each disorder.
   subjects and their family members will donate a blood sample, in the
   same way blood is drawn at a doctorâs office. all samples will be given
   an anonymous code number, and used only for research purposes. no names
   or personal information will be linked to the samples.
   in a large percentage of ndds patients, the genetic changes have not
   yet been identified. this study will use your samples for research
   purposes only, meaning that what we learn from the analysis of an
   individual's sample has no direct benefit for the individual. however,
   by gathering information from many individuals, we hope to learn more
   about how changes affecting genes can lead to ndds.
   the participation of many individuals with ndds and their family
   members is the necessary foundation for making these discoveries.
   children and young adults with a diagnosis of intellectual disability
   and/or autism spectrum disorders and/or epilepsy with unknown cause.
   parents and family members of those with ndds are eligible to
   participate whether or not they have ndds. research is usually more
   informative when both parents are enrolled in their childâs study.
   if you agree to participate, a questionnaire will be completed, you
   will participate in an interview, and donate a blood sample.

   as chief of the image acquisition core, dr. o'halloran's work is
   focused on bringing innovative new imaging techniques to bear on
   problems in basic and clinical research. his primary area of focus is
   on diffusion weighted imaging (dwi), in particular on high-resolution
   dwi. at high spatial resolution, dwi allows visualization of the white
   matter pathways that connect functional areas of the brain. one
   application of this technique that dr. o'halloran is focused on is in
   the planning of deep brain stimulation surgery to treat conditions such
   as parkinson's disease, dystonia, and depression. dr. o'halloran's
   other interests include image reconstruction and motion correction.
   patient motion continues to be a major problem in mri, causing failed

   drug discovery target identification and validation to meet the needs
   of patients has become even more challenging in spite of the huge
   amounts of genomic and metabolomic data available today.  close
   collaboration between biological and chemical sciences is vital to
   determine biological mechanisms of disease and to discover approaches
   to positively impact the disease state through intervention using
   molecular therapeutics. the research program of our laboratory is to
   develop novel chemical and biological tools in collaboration with our
   colleagues across the wide variety of therapeutic areas of interest to
   the mount sinai research community.  targets meeting sufficient
   criteria of validation have the opportunity to enter into the drug
   discovery portfolio of the experimental therapeutics institute.
    the laboratory supports many drug discovery and development activities
   including:
   -      evaluation of high throughput and virtual screens
   -      hit validation and follow-up
   -      lead identification
   -     chemical tools for in vivo studies in preclinical animal models
   of disease
   -  lead optimization with the eventual goal of  identification of
   candidates for clinical studies.
   in addition, an important focus of the laboratory is to develop key
   chemical and biochemical tools necessary to create translational and
   target engagement biomarkers, including imaging agents, to further
   understand the impact on disease states and underlying biology to
   effectively intervene in the designated disease pathway.
   the laboratory works toward the identification of novel chemical matter
   by developing new chemical processes and syntheses in the areas of
   heterocyclic chemistry and carbon-carbon bond forming reactions to
   access unexploited chemical space.

   dna damage and repair
   the long-term goal of this project is to develop a molecular
   understanding, derived from a combined theoretical-experimental
   collaborative approach, of the principles of specific dna damage
   recognition and repair. the collaboration is between this laboratory
   and that of j. b. alexander ross.
   two mechanisms of damage repair are important for the maintenance of
   the genetic material encoded in dna. one is the excision of the damage
   followed by a restoration of the correct dna sequence in a number of
   coordinated steps represented by the base excision pathway (ber). the
   other repair process is accomplished by an error-free translesion
   synthesis. we study the mechanism of damage recognition and its
   excision by two repair enzymes: endonuclease v (endov) recognizes a
   thymine dimer (td) and flips the complementary adenine to the 5-thymine
   of the td into a protein pocket before hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond
   of the td. uracil dna glycosylase (udg) recognizes uracil in dna, flips
   it into a specific pocket and hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond. it
   appears that the mechanism of base flipping is universal to base
   excision repair. thus, this project concentrates on understanding the
   molecular, energetic and kinetic elements that differentiate base
   flipping in damaged from undamaged dna.
   specificity of enzymes is determined not only by the recognition event,
   but also by the catalytic mechanism. the enzymatic catalysis of ber
   enzymes begins with a glycosylase step. the ionization states of
   several groups in the active sites of endov or udg are important for
   catalysis. we have computed the pka values of the amino acids in the
   active site of endov and on this basis we propose a catalytic mechanism
   of the glycosylase step in the enzyme (fuxreiter, m. warshel, a. osman,
   r. the role of active site residues in the glycosylase step of t4
   endonuclease v. computer simulation studies on ionization states.
   biochemistry, 38:9577-9589,1999). we have studied by md simulations the
   reactant and product states of udg in complex with its substrate and on
   the basis of structural, electrostatic and dynamic changes we propose a
   mechanism of catalysis for the enzyme (luo, n. mehler, e. osman, r.

    in our daily lives we often encounter both pleasurable and aversive
   situations, which heighten our emotional state and affect cognition.
   the ability to flexibly regulate our emotions in response to such
   events is essential for adapting to our environment and, ultimately,
   for our mental health. many forms of mental illness involve dysfunction
   in the neural systems that regulate affective processing and decision
   making. the limbic system, which includes parts of the prefrontal
   cortex and medial temporal lobe, is critical for regulating emotions
   and plays an essential role in cognition. the main focus of the
   rudebeck lab is to understand how interaction between the prefrontal
   cortex and subcortical structures such as the amygdala contribute to
   emotional regulation and decision-making. to do this, we use a
   combination of behavioral, autonomic, neurophysiological and
   interference methods in animal models.

   overview.
   â â â  the liver accomplishes an amazing array of physiological tasks,
   including energy homeostasis, xenobiotic metabolism, serum protein
   secretion and bile production. despite the remarkable regenerative
   capacity of the liver, it is not always able to undergo efficient
   repair, and diseases of the liver are common. our lab uses zebrafish to
   understand liver development and disease.
   the role of uhrf1 in liver development.
   figure 1. the liver is well formed in 5 day embryos. a. transgenic fish
   expressing gfp in hepatocytes. b. in situ hybridization with the fabp10
   hepatocyte-specific probe.
   figure 2. the liver is small in 4 day embryos that lack uhrf1. uhrf1
   morphants (bottom 4 larvae) expressing gfp in hepatocytes have small
   livers and developmental defects compared to controls (top)
   is uhrf1 an oncogene?
   â â â  our experiments demonstrate that uhrf1 is required for liver
   growth under physiologic conditions. our next question is to determine
   whether high levels of uhrf1 contribute to unregulated hepatocyte
   proliferation, as is found in hepatocellular carcinoma. to address this
   question, we collaborate with the mount sinai liver cancer research
   program directed by dr. josep llovet. we have found that uhrf1 is
   highly expressed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,
   and studies are underway to establish the significance of this finding.
   how does uhrf1 function to regulate hepatocyte proliferation?
   â â â  recent, exciting data indicates that a primary role of uhrf1 in
   mammals is to direct dna methyl transferase (dnmt1) to hemi-methylated
   dna during replication. uhrf1 is required for maintaining dna
   methylation and loss of uhrf1 causes significant changes in
   methylation. our working model is that zebrafish with depleted uhrf1
   fail to undergo methylation-mediated silencing of genes which halt the
   cell cycle (i.e. tumor suppressors). currently, work in the lab is
   focused on identifying potential important uhrf1 target genes.
   how is uhrf1 regulated?
   figure 3. uhrf1 is localized to the nucleus in mammalian cells.
   the genetics of fatty liver disease
   fatty liver disease is most frequently associated with obesity or
   alcohol abuse, and a range from fat accumulating in hepatocytes
   (steatosis) to the severe steatohepatitis fall under the umbrella of
   this disease. we are using zebrafish genetics to understand the factors
   that contribute to steatosis.
   alcoholic liver disease
   figure 4. acute exposure to ethanol causes steatosis in 4 day zebrafish
   larvae.
   metabolic liver disease
   figure 5. fgr mutants have hepatomegaly (top) and defective hepatocytes
   which do not store glycogen (bottom).
   the fgr gene is highly conserved in animals, and the fgr protein does
   not have any known function. efforts are underway to determine the
   cellular function of fgr and to elucidate the mechanism by which
   mutation of this novel gene gives rise to steatosis.â
   â â â  we find that fgr mutants have defects in protein secretion,
   activation of the unfolded protein response and hepatic endoplasmic
   reticulum (er) stress. current work is focused on determining how
   disruption of the secretory pathway and er stress causes steatosis.
   â© 2015 the mount sinai hospital
   our lab is interested in understanding how neurotrophic growth factors,
   including nerve growth factor (ngf) and brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor (bdnf), regulate nervous system development and function. we
   study neurotrophin action through the identification of gene products
   that these growth factors regulate in the cns and pns, determining how
   these proteins are involved in neurogenesis, axonal outgrowth and
   pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, using cellular
   and molecular tools, and knockout mouse models. together with the
   benson lab, we're currently examining how the ngf-regulated cell
   surface adhesion protein, called nilegp or l1, an immunoglobulin (ig)
   superfamily member that is expressed primarily in the nervous system,
   regulates axonal outgrowth, branching, pathfinding, and fasciculation,
   as well as neuronal migration. of note, inherited x-linked mutations in
   l1 result in hydrocephalus and mental retardation (crash and masa
   syndromes). in addition, we're trying to understand how the
   neurotrophin-inducible gene vgf, encoding a secreted `granin-like'
   protein and peptide precursor, controls energy expenditure, memory, and
   depressive behavior. recent collaborative studies with the huntley,
   alberini, shapiro, and duman laboratories indicate that vgf-derived
   peptides injected into the brain have anti-depressant efficacy,
   consistent with abnormalities noted in memory tasks and depressed
   behavior in vgf knockout mice, and that vgf regulates hippocampal
   synaptic activity via a bdnf-dependent mechanism. we are developing
   novel conditional and humanized knockout models to better understand
   vgf function in the developing and adult hippocampus, hypothalamus, and
   sympathetic nervous system.

   can we change our emotions? our lab is interested in discovering the
   neural mechanisms underlying emotional control and flexibility. because
   the environment we live in is constantly changing, we need to
   continuously update our emotional responses. in extreme situations,
   when emotional memories become traumatic, we might even wish to 'erase'
   emotional memories altogether. our research team uses neuroimaging,
   pharmacology and psychophysiology to understand the neural mechanisms
   that make such emotional flexibility. we examine emotional processing
   in the normal brain and in patients with anxiety disorders, and hope to
   promote new forms of treatment.
   our lab studies the neural mechanisms of memory in the everyday sense
   of the word: the ability to learn new facts and remember recent events.
   although for many years scientists believed that only one form of
   learning existed in the brain, we now know that different brain
   networks are crucial for different types of learning. for example, the
   hippocampus is needed to learn and remember new facts and recent
   events, the amygdala is crucial for earning emotional associations, and
   the neostriatum is required for certain forms of skill learning. my
   research focuses on how the hippocampus, refrontal cortex, and other
   brain areas contribute to memory in experimental animals, mostly rats,
   and how mechanisms of neuronal plasticity within these structures
   contribute to memory functions. experiments in my lab are guided by
   cognitive, computational, physiological, and pharmacological
   hypotheses.
   the basic idea is that the properties of the nmda receptor allows cells
   in the hippocampus to conjoin temporally overlapping cortical inputs
   into representations of events, and that recurrent connections within
   the hippocampus and between it and other structures allow these events
   to be linked into the sequences that comprise episodic memories.
   interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex allow
   specific memories to guide response rules, and different strategies and
   motives allow the prefrontal cortex to select among memories in
   otherwise identical situations. experiments investigating the links
   between these different levels of analysis are aimed toward providing
   an integrated perspective of memory.
   to study the molecular mechanisms of drug addiction and depression, a
   lot of high throughput experimental data have been generated. our lab
   focuses on the statistical and integrated analysis of these data and
   generates biological insights. we are especially interested in the
   next-generation sequencing data which provides a comprehensive and
   high-resolution view of the biological systems under study. we also
   develop bioinformatic tools employing bayesian inference and machine
   learning to aid our data analysis.

   our main research focus is on elucidation of the pathophysiology of
   primary dystonia through the investigations of its neuroimaging,
   neuropathological, clinical, genetic and environmental correlates. we
   are also interested in comparisons of imaging features of dystonia with
   other movement disorders, such as essential tremor and parkinson's
   disease.
   our recent research direction includes studies on functional and
   structural connectome of high frequency networks in epilepsy.
   using multi-disciplinary approach and novel technologies, we are
   developing a better understanding of normal and diseased states of the
   central nervous system, which will ultimately help develop new
   therapeutic options for patients with movement disorders and epilepsy.

   basic functions in the brain, such as making decisions, consuming food
   and forming memories, rely on a proper balance of excitatory and
   inhibitory neuronal signals. our research focuses on the function of
   potassium ion channels, which generate one of the inhibitory signals in
   the brain. we are particularly interested in g protein-regulated
   potassium channels and their role in drug addiction and mental
   disorders. we have unraveled the molecular details underlying g protein
   modulation, elucidated a structural mechanism of alcohol-mediated
   activation, and discovered drug-induced plasticity for these g
   protein-gated potassium channels. as potassium channels emerge as
   critical gatekeepers of neuronal excitability, the results of our
   research may lead to the development of more effective treatments for
   diverse neurological diseases such as epilepsy, down syndrome, alcohol
   abuse and drug addiction.

   hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with
   hepatitis b. this project involves both a retrospective and prospective
   component. the prospective arm includes a tumor banking protocol, from
   which over 100 human tumor and non-neoplastic liver parenchymal
   specimens have already been collected and cryopreserved. this is a
   highly unique tumor bank, and only includes hepatocellular cancers from
   patients with hepatitis b. a broad spectrum of tumors have already been
   collected from patients with varying degrees of underlying hepatic
   fibrosis, which is a unique characteristic seen in patients with
   hepatitis b associated hepatocellular carcinoma. dr hiotisâ hepatitis
   b-hepatocellular carcinoma research project is designed to evaluate
   differences in hepatocellular carcinoma that arise in patients with
   underlying cirrhosis, vs. those cancers that arise instead in livers
   with minimal or moderate fibrosis. his additional research activities
   also include participation in clinical trials for treatment of liver
   and gastrointestinal cancers, and basic science research focusing on
   cancer immunotherapy in a mouse model for hepatocellular carcinoma.
   dr.  hiotis is currently the vice chairman for surgical research at
   mount sinai. in this role, dr. hiotis administrates the coordinated
   clinical and basic science research efforts of a large department,
   including ten divisions and multiple full-time faculty members. he
   supervises the departmentâs research fellows, coordinators, and
   assistants.
   in addition to his administrative responsibilities in research, dr.
   hiotis also maintains a research endeavor of his own, oversees a basic
   science laboratory, and is the principal investigator of
   independently-funded scientific research. he is also actively engaged
   in several clinical trials.

   dr. aaronson is an internationally recognized cancer biologist, who in
   early studies established the transformation-competent but replication
   defective nature of mammalian sarcoma viruses and molecularly cloned
   many of their oncogenes. he and colleagues implicated
   retroviral-related oncogenes in human cancer through investigations
   including the initial detection of their expression in human tumors and
   critical contributions to the demonstration of their involvement in
   human cancer. his investigations of the v-sis oncogene established the
   first normal function of an oncogene and the role of oncogenes in
   growth factor signaling. his discovery of erbb2 as a v-erbb-related
   gene amplified in a human breast carcinoma and demonstration of its
   transforming properties paved the way for targeted therapies directed
   against its product.
   he isolated kgf (fgf7), a growth factor with novel epithelial cell
   specificity and demonstrated its involvement in wound repair. its
   successful phase iii clinical trial by amgen for treatment of
   mucositis, recently led the fda to approve kepivance (kgf) for
   treatment of this debilitating side effect of many cancer therapies.
   thus, dr. aaronson's pioneering discoveries have directly led to new
   therapies for cancer patients.
   his development and application of stable expression cdna cloning
   technology resulted in his identification of new human oncogenes,
   growth factor receptors, and other genes, which induce transformation
   or drug resistance. he and colleagues identified the protooncogene
   product, met, as the receptor for hgf/scatter factor and lrp5/6 as the
   receptor for a novel wnt antagonist, dkk1. this latter discovery paved
   the way for his recent demonstration with colleagues of a wnt autocrine
   transforming mechanism in human malignancies.
   dr. aaronson received his m.d. from ucsf in 1966. he joined the
   national institutes of health in 1967 and became chief of the
   laboratory of cellular and molecular biology at the national cancer
   institute in 1977. he joined mount sinai in 1994 and is the jack and
   jane b. aron professor and founding chair, emeritus of the department
   of oncological sciences. he is the recipient of numerous awards
   including the distinguished service medal from the u.s. public health
   service, the rhoads memorial award from the american association of
   cancer research, and the paul erhlich prize from germany. he is the
   author of over 530 publications, an inventor on more than 50 patents,
   and serves on numerous editorial boards and scientific advisory
   committees.

   research
   we use a multidisciplinary approach that combines behavioral,
   morphological, electrophysiological, cell biological and
   molecular-biological techniques to explain the neural basis of those
   forms of behavioral plasticity that are due to changes in the internal
   state of the organism. our primary interest is in mechanisms that
   establish internal states and in memory mechanisms that are responsible
   for persistence of these states.
   we have chosen to study internal states in a preparation that has a
   relatively simple nervous system - the marine mollusc aplysia
   californica. the central nervous system of this animal is distributed
   into several ganglia, each of which consists of a limited number of
   neurons, many of which are large and easily identifiable as unique
   individuals.
   the ability to recognize the same neurons from animal to animal has
   greatly facilitated the functional characterization of individual cells
   as sensory neurons, motor neurons and interneurons. this in turn has
   allowed the reconstruction of neuronal circuits that mediate a variety
   of behaviors. circuit-level analysis has provided new insights into the
   organization of neuronal networks into mediating and modulatory systems
   and led to a new conceptualization of command neurons.
   studies of transmitters and modulators involved in the regulation of
   behavior have resulted in purification and sequencing of several novel
   neuropeptides and to molecular cloning of the mrna of these molecules.
   these neuropeptides have now been localized to specific neurons, and
   shown to act as cotransmitters. to a large extent our research is now
   focused on the role that these peptidergic cotransmitters play in
   optimizing the efficiency of behavior in response to changes in the
   motivational state of the animal. we are particularly interested in
   determining:
   we expect that this approach will yield a unified picture in which our
   understanding of behavioral plasticity will extend all the way from
   behavior to the molecules involved.

   our research focuses on the cellular mechanisms underlying cns
   disorders and their treatment. we use advanced genetic mouse models,
   viral mediated gene transfer and optogenetics to understand the network
   and cell type specific mechanisms underlying chronic pain, addiction,
   and depression.   a large part of our work, concerns the study of rgs
   proteins (regulators of g protein signaling) in the brain.  rgs
   proteins modulate a number of important functions in the cns by
   regulating the activity of heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunits but
   also by various other interactions which affect receptor
   desentitization, ion channel function or transcriptional activity.  our
   earlier work revealed a potent role of rgs9-2 in the striatum in drug
   addiction and identified rgs9-2 complexes associated with agonist
   biased signaling. more recently, we explored the role of rgs4 in
   antidepressant drug actions and its role in various forms of chronic
   pain.
   we focus on five major research areas:
   signal transduction complexes in the striatum in drug addiction
   regulation of g protein signaling in stress and depression
   novel intracellular targets for chronic pain treatment
   epigenetic adaptations in chronic pain models
   regulators of g protein signaling and obesity

   ubiquitin signaling in cancer biology
    post-doctoral fellows: kenneth wu and xinson xu
   graduate student: jordan kovacev
   covalent linkage of ubiquitin chains to cellular proteins leads to
   targeted degradation by the 26s proteasome, thus promoting
   unidirectional alteration of a divergent array of cellular processes
   that include cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and tumor
   suppression.
   central to the ubiquitination reaction are the recognition of a
   substrate by an e3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which also functions to
   recruit an e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that catalyzes the transfer
   of ubiquitin to the target protein. work from this laboratory has
   helped uncovering a super-family of cullin-roc1 ring based e3 ligases.
   we are focusing on scf, the prototype of cullin-ring e3, with specific
   interest to understand the mechanisms by which it targets protein
   substrates for polyubiquitination and eventual proteasomal
   degradation.  given its broad spectrum of protein targets, the scf
   pathway profoundly impacts a wide range of biological processes,
   including cell growth and death, development, signal transduction,
   transcriptional control, genomic integrity, and tumor suppression.
   we have discovered an scf-like e3 ligase complex containing cul7, fbw8,
   skp1 and roc1. dysregulation of the cul7 e3 ligase has been directly
   linked to hereditary human diseases as cul7 germline mutations were
   found in patients with autosomal-recessive 3-m and yakuts short stature
   syndromes, which are characterized by profound pre- and postnatal
   growth retardation. recently, we have identified insulin receptor
   substrate 1, a critical mediator of insulin and insulin-like growth
   factor-1 signaling, as the proteolytic target of the cul7 e3 ligase,
   suggesting a role for cul7 as a novel growth regulator. we are
   currently exploring pathomechanistic insights into cul7-linked growth
   retardation syndromes.

   the lab is interested in molecular mechanisms of how neurons are born,
   how they extend axons, and how they regenerate or fail to regenerate
   after mammalian cns injury. we use in vivo axon injury models, neuronal
   cultures, molecular biology, and various imaging and tissue engineering
   techniques to study classic and identify novel signaling pathways and
   epigenetic mechanisms that promote neurogenesis and axonogenesis. such
   knowledge is crucial for targeting molecules for effective cns
   regeneration. similar mechanisms also have relevance in cns tumor
   biology. discovering the molecular driving forces of tumor stem cell
   migration, proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal will point
   to novel therapeutic approaches.
   what determines whether a change in the external environment evokes a
   motor response?
   we address this question in an experimentally advantageous preparation,
   the mollusc aplysia. we study food-induced changes in biting that occur
   under some circumstances and not under others. we focus on forms of
   short term plasticity that are important in this context, and
   characterize them using electrophysiological, morphological,
   behavioral, and imaging techniques. current projects focus on
   mechanisms that regulate spike propagation in sensory neurons and
   mechanisms that regulate the efficacy of synaptic transmission.
   research in the dickstein lab focuses on the structural changes on
   neurons with ageing and disease. our main research interests focus on
   alzheimer's disease and parkinson's disease, specifically targeting
   cells of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, areas crucial for
   cognition. we also investigate the effects of cancers and chemotherapy
   on neuronal and synapse integrity. we use a combination of transgenic
   mouse models, neuroanatomy, and confocal and electron microscopy to
   analyze the changes that neurons and synapses undergo during disease.

   in parallel studies, we have recently discovered that the large family
   of potassium channel proteins, that include the g protein-sensitive
   channels, function by direct interactions with phosphatidylinositol
   phospholipids in the plasma membrane. g protein signaling is likely to
   activate these channels conformationally by adjusting channel
   phospholipid interactions. moreover, signaling pathways that regulate
   the level of these phospholipids critically affect the function of
   these potassium channels. \r\n\r\n\r\n
   cardiac and neuronal cells of the central nervous system, where these
   channels are prevalent, are isolated from heart and brain and are
   studied electrophysiologically. transgenic models with defects in g
   proteins or the potassium channel are used to elucidate the functional
   importance of these molecules in the particular tissue and the whole
   organism. \r\n\r\n\r\n
   the lab employs electrophysiological techniques to assay ion channel
   function (patch clamp, two-electrode voltage clamp). molecular
   biological techniques are used to clone and perform structure-function
   studies on these potassium channels. expression of recombinant channels
   in xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines are used routinely towards
   mechanistic studies. cell isolation methods and tissue culture
   techniques are also routinely used. confocal microscopy is used to
   localize the channel proteins in cells and tissues. \r\n\r\n

   dr. e. premkumar reddy obtained his ph.d. in 1971 and carried out his
   post-doctoral training at the ucla school of medicine from 1972-1974
   and later at the national cancer institute from 1974-75.   he worked at
   the national cancer institute first as an independent investigator and
   later as a section chief between 1975 and 1984.  in 1984, he moved to
   hoffmann la roche and held appointments at hoffmann la roche and the
   roche institute of molecular biology as a full member.  in 1986, he
   joined the wistar institute as a professor and deputy director.  from
   1992 to 2010, he served as the director of the fels institute for
   cancer research and molecular biology, temple university school of
   medicine, philadelphia. he joined the mount sinai school of medicine in
   march of 2010 as a professor in the departments of oncological sciences
   and the department of structural and chemical biology and as the
   director of experimental cancer therapeutics.
   while working at the national cancer institute, he made a number of
   seminal discoveries that provided a clear understanding of the
   molecular basis of cancer.  he cloned and sequenced a number of viral
   oncogenes which included abl, ras, fgr, mos, myb, myc and sis oncogenes
   and their cellular homologues which pinpointed the precise changes that
   cellular proto-oncogenes undergo to produce cancer-causing viral
   oncogenes.   he extended this work to human cancers and was responsible
   for the seminal discovery that point mutations in the cellular ras
   genes result in their oncogenic activation.  his work also showed the
   mechanisms associated with the activation of abl and myb oncogenes,
   which are associated with the development of human myelogenous
   leukemias. his recent work on cell cycle regulator, cdk4 has shown that
   this gene is very critical for the development of erbb2 and ras
   oncogene-induced tumors and inhibition of expression of cdk4 causes
   ablation of breast cancers caused by erbb2 and ras oncogenes.
   dr. reddy has pioneered the development of small molecule inhibitors
   targeted against oncogenes and cell cycle regulators for cancer
   therapy.  one of the drugs developed by dr. reddy, on01910 is currently
   in phase iii clinical trials and has shown profound clinical activity
   in mds (myelodysplastic syndrome) patients as a single agent.  in
   combination with oxaliplatin and gemcitabine, on01910 was found to have
   remarkable efficacy in reducing the tumor burden of several metastatic
   cancers including breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers.   in addition
   to on01910, dr. reddy has developed six different cancer drugs, two of
   which (on013100, and on01210) have entered clinical trials and the
   other three are expected to enter clinical trials in the next one
   year.  two of these drugs, a small molecule inhibitor of plk2,
   on1231320 and a second compounds on123300 which is a dual inhibitor of
   cdk4 and akt pathways are currently undergoing pre-clinical evaluation.
   dr. reddy  founded the cancer journal oncogene in 1986 and served as
   its editor from 1986 to 2009.  in 2010, he founded a second cancer
   journal, genes & cancer for which he currently serves as the
   editor-in-chief.

   my research interests are at the interface of chemistry and biology.
   specifically my lab develops and uses optical probes, called "caged
   compounds", to understand fundamental principles in cellular
   physiology. i have worked in this field since my post-doctoral studies
   at the university of pennsylvania in the late 1980s. during that time i
   published two seminal papers developing the most widely used caged
   calcium probes (pnas 1988, 1994). these light-sensitive reagents have
   been the basis of 100s of biological studies in many disciples. since
   1995 i have had an independent lab that has been continuously funded by
   the us national institutes of health. during this period the focus of
   my research has been developing and using tools for two-photon
   microscopy. in 2001 we published a seminal paper in this field, which
   was the first example of optical stimulation of visually designated
   single synapses (nature neuroscience). this work proved the foundation
   for work by many neuroscience labs around the world. my recent research
   at mount sinai has involved developing new probes that allow
   chromatically selective, multi-color uncaging. with this work we have
   taken optical stimulation of cells out of the "monochrome era" so as to
   enable bi-directional control of neuronal signaling with different
   colors of light for the first time.
   in the past 30 years the use of fluorescence imaging in biological
   sciences has been as important as dna-based methods advancing our
   understanding in almost every field. (nobel prizes for gfp (2008) and
   super resolution imaging (2014) are testament to this.) my work during
   this period has pioneered the use of light to control cell function,
   the optical tools we have made have proved to be conceptual fundamental
   enabling technologies. the goal of my current and future work is to be
   equally transformative.
   my lab uses organic chemistry to develop new optical methods for cell
   physiology.

   model of the bulky analog n6-(benzyl)-adp docked in the expanded active
   site of analog-sensitive (as) mutant human cdk2
   a network in control of cell division and gene expression
   how do cells decide when to divide and, having committed to that fate,
   how do they faithfully duplicate and segregate their contentsâincluding
   their dna? among the progeny of these divisions, which all carry the
   same genetic information, how are different programs of gene expression
   established and maintained? our lab studies the regulation of both
   processesâcell division and gene expressionâby a network of
   cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). we take a chemical genetic approach,
   by expanding the atp-binding pocket of a targeted cdk to accommodate
   bulky atp analogsâboth inhibitors and substratesâthat cannot bind to
   the wild-type kinase (figure). in multicellular organisms, cell-cycle
   and transcriptional cdk networks are linked by cdk7, the cdk-activating
   kinase (cak), which is also part of the general transcription factor
   tfiih. we determined how cdk7 coordinates its cell-cycle function with
   a second essential function during the transcription cycle of rna
   polymerase (rnap) ii. our studies reveal similarities of organization
   cycles, in which checkpoints and surveillance systems enforce fidelity,
   directionality and irreversibility. by chemical genetic analysis of the
   cdk network we hope to define the precise roles and targets of specific
   cdk-cyclin complexes in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulation, and
   to identify potential vulnerabilities of cancer cells to specific cdk
   inhibitors.

   our research is directed towards the study of selective neuronal
   vulnerability in dementing illnesses using classical neuropathological
   as well as modern quantitative immunohistochemical methods. we intend
   to develop a quantitative, detailed and cohesive definition of neuronal
   susceptibility to degeneration in the cerebral cortex, by extending
   data on alzheimer disease to other dementing disorders as well as
   animal models of age-related illnesses, and by defining the key
   neurochemical and morphological characteristics linked to relative
   vulnerability (or resistance to degeneration) of identified neuronal
   populations. the regional and laminar distribution in the cerebral
   cortex of specific neuronal populations is investigated in a variety of
   neurodegenerative disorders, and quantitatively compared to alzheimer
   disease and control brains. in addition, a detailed study of brains
   from aged patients with no records of neurological and psychiatric
   disorders is performed in order to define further the limits of normal
   aging in the brain.
   we employ advanced microscopy, high field magnetic resonance imaging,
   stereologic, and modeling approaches to develop an accurate
   quantitative assessment of such pathological changes in a region- and
   layer-specific manner. neuronal morphology is analyzed in a
   quantitative manner using intracellular injection of hippocampal and
   neocortical neurons coupled with computerized reconstruction to assess
   the degree to which the accumulation of pathologic markers causes
   dendritic atrophy and spine loss in different subtypes of neocortical
   pyramidal cells subserving cortical circuits critical for memory and
   cognition. the characterization of such vulnerable neurons and circuits
   is fundamental to the design of therapeutic strategies aiming at their
   protection or rescue. similar approaches are applied to the
   neuropathology of schizophrenia and autism.
   finally we are investigating mammalian brain evolution with a focus on
   cetaceans and great apes. these studies have led us to identify
   specific neuronal types in parts of the cerebral cortex known to be
   involved in social awareness, judgment, and attention that can be
   considered as markers of adaptive mechanisms and functions in response
   to particular ecological pressure.

   synapse structure and function is continuously modified during
   development and throughout life by experience, such as learning new
   skills or forming new memories. such synaptic plasticity is thus
   critical for normal brain function. synaptic plasticity can also become
   maladaptive under conditions of brain, spinal or peripheral nerve
   injury, leading to abnormal function or sensation. dr. huntley's
   research focuses on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity through which
   synaptic structure and function are modified by experience or injury.
   research projects include: 1) the role of the cadherin family of
   synaptic adhesion proteins in synapse and circuit development,
   3) molecules and mechanisms regulating aberrant corticostriatal circuit
   development and plasticity in autism and parkinson's disease models.

   the explosion of large-scale, high-throughput technologies in the
   biological sciences demands a comprehensive view of biological
   systems.   dr. zhu's research focuses on:
   1.     method development in integrating diverse high-throughput data
   into probabilistic causal network models.  there are multiple risk
   factors as well as their interactions contributing to complex human
   diseases, such genetic background, infection, environmental states,
   life-style choices, and etc.   it is critical to integrate all these
   factors into comprehensive disease networks which provide a context to
   understand mechanism of diseases and to study effects of genetic
   perturbations, drug perturbations, and their interactions.  dr. zhu's
   group has developed many methods for integrating genetic and genomic
   data into bayesian networks:
   2.     method development in comparing multiple networks.  there are
   multiple risk/perturbation factors driving a biological system from a
   healthy state to a disease state.  in response, there are hundreds to
   thousands genes changed at transcription or protein levels.  dr. zhu's
   works showed that instead of monitoring changes in a few genes, it is
   more robust to monitor changes of network states or structures when
   studying complex diseases:
   3.     method development in analyzing biological networks.  if
   comprehensive biological networks are available, how to convert network
   knowledge into actionable items?  for example in drug discovery and
   development, we investigated which nodes and node combinations in the
   networks can generate largest beneficial effects when perturbed.  in
   biomarker research, we examined which parts of networks can robustly
   connect to drug response, disease progression and survivals.

   we explore information processing in the nervous system, and use the
   visual system as a convenient model. we employ systems analysis,
   borrowed from communication engineering, as the conceptual and
   methodological framework. we use single and multi-neuron recordings and
   optical imaging of neuronal activity, and have developed sophisticated
   techniques for stimulation of the visual system, and for the analysis
   of neuronal responses to these stimuli. we also record simultaneously
   the input and output of neurons in the visual thalamic nucleus, the
   lateral geniculate nucleus (lgn), in order to learn how information
   transmission from the retina to the visual cortex through the lgn is
   controlled. applied mathematics and computers are used extensively for
   stimulation, analysis and modeling of the systems under study.
    currently we are investigating the properties of visual neurons in the
   retina, lgn and visual cortex of monkeys and cats, with an emphasis on
   the temporal, spatial and chromatic selectivities of these cells, and
   on the nature, source and function of the variability (noise) of
   neuronal responses. since perception and behavior involve the
   coordinated activity of many interacting neurons, we also use optical
   imaging to visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of activity in
   neuronal ensembles in the visual cortex. in addition, we are recording
   from groups of neurons in the lgn and visual cortex, and study their
   dynamical interractions and the information that these neuronal
   ensembles carry. the experimental approaches are augmented by
   computational modeling of lgn neurons and cortical circuits. the topics
   we are focused on currently include: the representation of color in the
   primate visual cortex, the transmission of information from retina to
   cortex via the lgn, and the role of the descending pathways in the
   brain.
    recently we have started to record from populations of neurons in the
   brains of mice, from regions involved in depression, drug addiction and
   post-traumatic-stress-disorder (ptsd). the recorded regions incluide
   the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area (vta). we subject
   the recordings to various mathematical methods that quantify the
   population behavior, in order to determine whether pathological
   behavior is reflected in the network behavior.
   our research is supported by grants from the nih's eye institute,
   institute for general medical sciences, and the institute for
   mathematical & biological synthesis.
    our research focuses on the analysis of human genetic variation to
   address fundamental questions in biology, medicine and anthropology. we
   are interested in detecting patterns of demography in genomic data to
   inform our inference of human evolution and history, and result in
   better outcomes for medical genomics. we combine population genetics
   theory, complex disease mapping, statistical modeling and
   experimentation to gain a deeper understanding of the landscape of
   genetic variation in global populations and its impact on function,
   fitness and adaptation. a detailed description of current projects can

   research focus
   epigenetic regulation in stem cells and human diseases.
   â â â  our research is focused on genomic imprinting. we are analyzing
   the acquisition and maintenance of genomic dna methylation imprints in
   mouse as well as in es and ips cells. we are also applying our zfp57
   knockout mouse to modeling of imprinting related complex human diseases
   such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
   genomic imprinting in stem cells
   â â â  genomic imprinting is essential for mammalian development.
   consistent with this, a majority of cloned embryos die in utero, mainly
   from the failure to re-establish proper genomic imprints. cell-based
   therapies offer great hopes for various degenerative diseases,
   including alzheimerâs disease and diabetes. embryonic stem (es) cells
   derived from nuclear transfer experiments and induced pluripotent stem
   (ips) cells reprogrammed from adult cells are candidates for this
   therapeutic approach. however, they all have genomic imprinting defects
   which can inhibit differentiation and may even cause cancer. recently,
   it was reported that dysregulation of the dlk1-dio3 imprinted domain is
   the only notable difference between es cells and ips cells (stadtfeld,
   m. et al. nature, 2010). indeed, hypermethylation and aberrant
   expression of the imprinted genes were observed at the dlk1-dio3
   imprinted region in ips cells therefore, it is important to know how to
   manipulate the genomic imprinting machinery in pluripotent stem cells
   including ips and ntes cells so that proper development of different
   lineages of cells can be achieved for therapeutic applications.â
   â â â  the current major focus of our lab is to analyze acquisition and
   maintenance of genomic imprinting in stem cells as well as in mouse
   embryos. recently, we discovered that zfp57 is highly enriched in es
   cells and is a key regulator in genomic imprinting at multiple
   imprinted regions including the dlk1-dio3 domain. loss of zfp57 results
   in loss of dna methylation genomic imprints at these imprinted regions.
   consistent with our finding, mutations in human zfp57 result in
   hypomethylation at multiple imprinted regions. currently we are
   actively investigating the underlying mechanisms of zfp57-associated
   complexes in the acquisition and maintenance of dna methylation
   imprints in both mouse embryos and es cells.
   mechanisms in genomic imprinting
   â â â  despite that genomic imprinting was identified in mammals almost
   three decades ago, many unanswered questions persist about the nature
   of genomic imprinting memory and about how genomic imprints are
   established and maintained. zfp57 has both maternal and zygotic
   functions and it exhibits maternal-zygotic embryonic lethality, the
   first one identified in mammals. zfp57 maintains both paternal and
   maternal genomic imprints and may target dna methyltransferases to the
   imprinting control regions (icr). interestingly, these germline-derived
   differential dna methylation imprints at the icrs can be lost in
   embryos in the absence of both maternal and zygotic zfp57 and they can
   be acquired in mouse embryos in the presence of zygotic zfp57 even
   though they are not established in the germline. moreover, acquisition
   of dna methylation in mouse embryos occurs in an allele-specific
   fashion, suggesting the presence of dna methylation-independent
   heritable imprinting memory such as heritable histone modifications.
   therefore, further functional analysis of zfp57 in genomic imprinting
   will help us to achieve a better understanding of the molecular nature
   of imprinting memory as well as the temporal and developmental control
   of dna methylation imprints.
   modeling complex human diseases
   â â â  dysregulation of imprinting genes can lead to cancer,
   neurological diseases, diabetes and other kinds of human diseases.
   indeed, mutations in human zfp57 are associated with transient neonatal
   diabetes, congenital heart defects and abnormal development of the
   nervous system. we have independently discovered that zfp57 mutant
   mouse is obese and display similar defects in the cardiovascular
   system. thus, our zfp57 mutant mouse could serve as useful animal
   models for complex human diseases such as obesity, diabetes and
   cardiovascular diseases.
   figure 1.â  rna in-situ hybridization reveals that zfp57 is expressed
   specifically in the oocytes (purple stain) within the follicles.
   .
   figure 2.â zfp57 is involved in the acquisition, maintenance and
   re-acquisition of dna methylation genomic imprints. paternal
   chromosomes are indicated by blue lines. ig, ig-dmr. sn, snrpn dmr.

   shaded circles, partially methylated cpgs. -/-, a homozygous zfp57
   embryo. -/+, a heterozygous zfp57 embryo derived from a null female.
   differential dna methylation at the cpg sites of imprinting control
   regions (icr) is reset during gametogenesis. in sperm, the cpg sites at
   the ig-dmr (ig) of the dlk1-dio3 imprinted domain are methylated while
   those at the snrpn dmr (sn) are unmethylated. by contrast, methylation
   occurs at the snrpn dmr but not at the ig-dmr in the ooytes derived
   from wild-type females. upon fertilization, differential methylation is
   reconstituted at the icrs in the wild-type zygote (zygote (1)). these
   germline-derived differential dna methylation imprints are resistant to
   genome-wide pronuclear demethylation in the zygote and stably
   maintained in wild-type embryos. without zygotic zfp57, differential
   dna methylation is partially lost in the zygotic mutant embryos around
   mid-gestation (midgestation embryo (a)). when both maternal and zygotic
   zfp57 are absent, differential dna methylation is completely missing in
   the mid-gestation maternal-zygotic mutant embryos (midgestation embryo
   (b)). without maternal zfp57, dna methylation is not established at the
   cpg sites of the snrpn dmr in the oocytes derived from zfp57 homozygous
   female mice. in pre-implantation embryos lacking maternal zfp57 (zygote
   (2)), differential dna methylation at the snrpn dmr remains absent.
   intriguingly, differential dna methylation is re-acquired
   allele-specifically at the maternal chromosome of the snrpn dmr in the
   presence of the zygotic zfp57 in about 50% of the heterozygous embryos
   derived from null female mice (li et al., 2008).

   â â â the focus of our research is to understand the molecular and
   cellular nature of the undifferentiated stem cell "states", and how
   such states are altered during a change in cell fate. the underlying
   rationale for our studies is that the complement of gene-products and
   their inter-relationships that exist in stem cells accounts for their
   remarkable abilities to balance self-renewal and differentiation
   decision processes. we study both adult and embryonic stem (es) cells,
   primarily from the mouse, but also from the human. as a first step, we
   have comprehensively identified most, if not all gene-products that are
   expressed in highly purified hematopoietic stem cell (hsc). we
   performed similar analyses in mouse es cells. such molecular
   "signatures" provide parts-lists that are available to the stem cells.
   the challenge has been to functionally address the roles that these
   molecules play in mediating the biological properties of hsc and es
   cells. further, we would like to understand how these molecular
   components are "wired" into regulatory signaling and transcriptional
   networks.
   â â â to explore these issues we have utilized a number of global
   gene-expression perturbation technologies, such as inhibitory short
   hairpin rna (shrna). we have successfully down regulated the expression
   levels of candidate regulatory molecules in both hsc and es cells. a
   number of these play crucial regulatory roles in processes such as
   self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. we have further
   developed strategies that allow the analyses of cell-fate change
   dynamics at multiple biochemical and molecular levels in response to
   defined and precisely controlled changes in the expression levels of
   key regulatory molecules. these strategies have provided the first
   in-depth view of how a cell-fate decision actually occurs at the
   transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and
   post-translational levels. an important aspect of our overall efforts
   is computational and quantitative analyses. we anticipate that our
   approach will yield a systems biology level description and
   understanding of stem cell decision processes. this in turn, will have
   profound implications in future efforts focused on applying basic stem
   cell research in translational as well as clinical contexts.

   â â â â â â my research is focused on defining the cellular and
   molecular nature of hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) and the molecular
   cross-talk that occurs between stem cells and their niche. we use
   transgenic mouse models to study hsc during normal homeostasis and
   after stress. we are interested in the basic property of self-renewal
   and whether hscs really do self-renew to full functional potential when
   they undergo cell division. the lab is also using specific factors to
   directly induce hemogenesis from somatic cells, both mouse and human.
   we have shown that the induction process recapitulates developmental
   hematopoies and molecular cues from these studies have led to a new
   investigation of hsc precursor populations during embryonic
   development. overall our studies will have broad implications on the
   behavior of all stem cells including those that contribute to
   metastatic cancer and leukemias.â

   summary of research studies:
   perhaps the most fundamental process in biology is that by which one
   cell becomes two. our research focuses on two related aspects of the
   biology that controls the integrity of the genome.
   1. we study the control of the cell division cycle, and the signaling
   pathways (checkpoints) that respond to chromosomal damage and prevent
   cell cycle progression until that damage is repaired.
   dna damage checkpoints function throughout the cell cycle. those
   working in g1 phase to prevent the replication of damaged dna are
   almost invariably mutated or inactivated in cancers. these defects
   contribute not only to the instability of tumor cell genomes, but can
   also knock-out pro-apoptotic pathways, rendering tumors resistant to
   treatment. those functioning in g2 phase to prevent commitment to
   mitosis are, however, virtually always intact and appear to be required
   for the viability of tumor cells that lack g1 checkpoints. our research
   is geared to dissect the molecular and cell biology of g2 checkpoints,
   and aims to use this knowledge in the design and testing of targeted
   anti-cancer therapies. taking genetic and genomic approaches, we
   utilize fission yeast as a gene and pathway discovery tool, and then
   apply this information to studies in human cells. we are currently
   focusing our efforts into: (1) the regulation and function of a
   checkpoint effector protein kinase, chk1, informing its suitability as
   modify lesions in dna into structures that signal the checkpoint and
   can be repaired.
   2. we are investigating how determinants of chromosome structure
   regulate chromosome segregation and dna repair, with an emphasis on
   events that occur during dna replication.
   chromosomes are highly dynamic structures. they undergo massive
   reorganization to enable dna replication and chromosome segregation to
   occur. this is under the control of the dna topoisomerases, and three
   related and interacting structural maintenance of chromosomes (smc)
   complexes known as cohesin, condensin and the smc5/6 complex. defects
   in the processes controlled by these enzymes are a potent inducer of
   chromosome segregation defects leading to changes in chromosome number
   (aneuploidy). their function during dna replication appears to be
   particularly important, where they control recombination to ensure a
   complete round of replication by overcoming obstacles that block
   polymerases, which is then followed by chromosome reorganization in
   preparation for mitosis.  with the importance of replication fidelity,

   the main research interest of my laboratory is in understanding the
   mechanisms of cancer metastasis via the lymphatic system and the
   function of lymphatic vessels in the regulation of immune response.
   metastasis is the main cause of treatment failure and death for cancer
   patients. the first site to which cancer cells metastasize are lymph
   nodes, and the extent of lymph node involvement is a major criterion
   for evaluating patient prognosis and the choice of therapy. despite the
   fact that the importance of the lymphatic system as a pathway for
   cancer metastasis has been well recognized, research efforts over the
   past decades have been focused primarily on understanding the
   mechanisms of tumor spread via the blood vasculature. thus, the
   mechanisms of tumor spread via the lymphatic system remain poorly
   understood. aside from serving as a transport system for tumor cells,
   the lymphatic system normally collects extravasated fluid,
   macromolecules and leukocytes from tissues and returns them to the
   blood circulation. by directing antigen-presenting cells, t-cells and
   antigens from peripheral tissues into the lymph nodes, lymphatic
   vessels play an important role in the initiation of immune response.
   however, the mechanisms by which leukocytes are mobilized into the
   lymphatic vessels are poorly understood, and in particular, the role of
   lymphatic vessels in the process remains unknown.
   our long-term research efforts are dedicated towards elucidating the
   molecular mechanisms which regulate lymphatic vessel growth (i.e.
   lymphangiogenesis) and the function of lymphatic vessels in cancer and
   in normal physiology. current research includes investigations of the
   mechanisms by which tumor cells interact with the lymphatic vasculature
   during early steps of metastasis. we are investigating the role of role
   of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules expressed by the lymphatic
   endothelium in tumor invasion and metastasis, to gain insight into the
   mechanisms which regulate tumor cell migration and entry into the
   lymphatic vessels. we are also investigating the molecular mechanisms
   of lymphangiogenesis. our previous studies have demonstrated that the
   induction of tumor lymphangiogenesis by the vascular endothelial growth
   factor-c (vegf-c) facilitates tumor metastases. the goals of our
   current research activities are to better understand the mechanisms by
   which vegf-c promotes metastasis and to assess the potential of vegf-c
   and its receptors as targets for the anti-metastatic therapy. our
   efforts are also dedicated towards identification of novel
   lymphangiogenic factors and markers of the lymphatic endothelium.
   finally, the lab is exploring the role of lymphatic vasculature in the
   regulation of immune response, particularly its function in regulating
   migration and activation of antigen-presenting cells. the ultimate goal
   of these studies is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by
   which lymphatic endothelial cells control physiological cell migration
   and to examine whether tumor cells take advantage of these mechanisms
   to gain access to the lymphatic vessels. the knowledge gained with the
   above studies may provide a foundation for the development of new
   therapeutic approaches to predict, arrest and treat cancer metastases.

   summary of research studies:
   research in my laboratory centers on developing computational
   techniques for the modeling and understanding of complex molecular
   systems such as proteins and nucleic acids in their aqueous
   environments. the methods developed are applied to problems of interest
   in structural biology. methodological developments focus on novel
   techniques to calculate free energy from computer simulations, on
   extending the range of applicability of grand-canonical ensemble
   simulations, on enhancing monte carlo sampling algorithms and on
   developing novel approaches to the analysis and visualization of
   macromolecular structures and computer simulation results. these
   techniques are applied to the calculation of the solvent contribution
   to conformational free energy differences between various conformation
   lipid bilayers. in addition, ligand-protein interactions are studied by
   docking tecniques and by molecular dynamics. recent work showed that
   grand-canonical ensemble simulations can be used to predict sites for
   derivatizing a ligand in order to enhance its binding affinity.

   what causes aging and age-related diseases, especially obesity,
   diabetes, and alzheimer's disease?
   the metabolic mystery: obesity and diabetes (a surfeit of nutritional
   resources) accelerate many age-related diseases, and dietary
   restriction (a dearthof nutritional resources) slows down aging itself
   and almost all age-related diseases. what's up with that?
   can we develop a drug to mimic all the protective effects of dietary
   restriction? (yes!)
   our laboratory uses histological, behavioral, electrophysiological, and
   molecular, methods (including dna microarrays and rna interference) to
   assess the basic mechanisms by which hypothalamic neurons sense and
   regulate metabolic state (including body weight and food intake), and
   how these mechanisms are impaired in metabolic diseases and during
   aging. a driving question of our laboratory is what may be called the
   metabolic mystery. this refers to the fascinating phenomenon that
   obesity is a risk factor for most age-related diseases and indeed for
   mortality, and conversely dietary restriction appears to slow down the
   aging process and extend maximum lifespan. considering that almost all
   major pathologies are influenced by caloric intake, the mechanisms
   underlying the metabolic mystery may be considered among the most
   compelling in biomedical science. we really don't understand why
   caloric intake should lead to diseases, but many lines of evidence
   suggest neuroendocrine mechanisms. we have begun to study the nature of
   the hypothalamic neurons which are sensitive to nutrition and which in
   turn regulate metabolic state, and we have thus begun to define a
   "nutritional field" of neurons which contain overlapping domains
   sensitive to different nutrients and which regulate different aspects
   of metabolism. of particular interest is that the maximum overlap of
   these nutritional stimulation (e.g., glucose and leptin) may occur
   within the pomc neurons, which we now believe play a critical role in
   regulating metabolism. this is particularly interesting because the
   pomc neurons are among the most sensitive to decline during aging. to
   begin to directly test the role of specific gene products in the
   development of obesity, diabetes, and aging, we have now produced
   several lines of transgenic mice that overexpress leptin, pomc,
   insulin, and glucokinase specifically in the brain, and we are now
   assessing the effects of these transgenes in obesity, diabetes, and
   aging. for example, we have now shown that transgenic enhancement of
   neuronal pomc will completely correct the diabetes and other
   impairments in genetically obese mice. these studies have led to
   discovery of a new class of anti-obesity drugs that we are now
   studying. a new direction in our laboratory involves examining function
   of metabolic genes we have discovered using microarrays using rna
   interference protocols in mice and in c. elegans. using high-throughput
   rnai screening methods we have discovered over 20 novel genes that
   regulate obesity in c. elegans. using a similar approach we have also
   discovered a transcriptional complex that mediates the protective
   effects of dietary restriction to increase lifespan and protect against
   age-related diseases, including alzheimer-type pathology and diabetic
   complications. pharmacological activation of this pathway increases
   lifespan and protects against neurodegenerative diseases, and the same
   complex predicts lifespan and obesity in mice. we have now also
   developed novel high-throughput methods to discover novel anti-obesity
   and anti-diabetes drugs, and have discovered over 20 drugs in each
   class so far.
   what is the hypothesis?
   a key observation about the nature of age-related impairments is that
   these impairments accrue over time, reflecting a cumulative and
   apparently irreversible process. we have now discovered the molecular
   mechanism of this "molecular memory" effect and shown that it applies
   to all age-related diseases that are influenced by dietary restriction.
   in particular this process explains the cumulative development of
   diabetic complications, and implies that both age-related impairments
   and diabetic complications can not only be slowed (as with dietary
   restriction) but can actually be reveresed, by blocking glucose
   metabolism more effectively than can be done with dietary restriction.

   we work on synaptic plasticity, the aging brain, and the synaptic basis
   of age-related cognitive decline. we are particularly interested in the
   distinction between alzheimer's disease (ad) and the more modest
   disruption of memory often referred to as age-associated cognitive
   impairment or mild cognitive impairment (mci) that often occurs in the
   context of normal aging. while age-associated cognitive impairment
   represents a major health problem on its own that must be solved,
   preventing the transition from mci to ad is a related goal of enormous
   importance given the rising threat and cost of ad to western society.
   in order to achieve either goal, we need to understand the cellular,
   synaptic, and molecular basis of the earliest age-related alterations
   that lead to cognitive decline and how these events relate to the
   complex physiology of aging, such as the aging of endocrine systems
   that affect the brain, or the interactions between stress and aging.
   for example, in ad, the cortical neurons that provide the complex
   connections that mediate cognition degenerate, leading to the
   catastrophic loss of cognitive function evident in dementia. unlike ad,
   significant neuron death does not occur in normal aging and thus does
   not appear to be the cause of the initial stages of age-associated
   cognitive impairment. while these circuits do not die in normal aging,
   we have shown that they are vulnerable to sub-lethal age-related
   alterations in structure, synaptic integrity, and molecular processing
   at the synapse, all of which impair cognitive function in
   well-characterized animal models. in addition, while synapse loss
   occurs in aging, all synapses are not equally vulnerable and all
   regions do not age the same way. our recent data on prefrontal cortex
   show that there is a selective loss of the class of synapses that is
   most plastic and likely to play a critical role in the cognitive
   processes mediated by prefrontal cortex, yet the age-related synaptic
   alterations in hippocampus are quite different, with minimal synapse
   loss. biochemical alterations of the synapse, such as shifts in
   distribution or abundance of key neurotransmitter receptors, may also
   contribute to memory impairment, particularly in hippocampus.
   we have shown that the same brain regions and circuits vulnerable to
   aging are responsive to circulating estrogen levels, suggesting that
   critical interactions between reproductive senescence and brain aging
   may affect excitatory synaptic transmission and cognitive performance.
   in fact, estrogen treatment in aged female monkeys protected the
   vulnerable class of synapses and restored cognitive performance to that
   of young monkeys. importantly, the effects of estrogen on these neurons
   show that certain age-associated synaptic alterations may be
   reversible, leading to the protection of cognitive performance observed
   in these monkeys. these effects of estrogen give us a molecular and
   therapeutic entry point to explore additional interventions and
   strategies to protect against synaptic aging. if we can prevent the
   synaptic aging of these circuits while still largely intact, we may be
   able to protect individuals against the earliest stages of cognitive
   decline and in turn, prevent the transition to the death of these
   circuits that underlies ad.
   a parallel area of research in our lab investigates the effects of
   behavioral stress on neurons in the prefrontal cortex. we have shown
   that stress leads to dendritic retraction on pyramidal neurons in
   prefrontal cortex, and this leads to cognitive decline. importantly, if
   stress is discontinued these neurons recover, both structurally and
   functionally. in addition, the specific neuronal responses to stress
   differ between males and females. all of these studies were done in
   young animals, but recently, we were able to link our investigations
   into neuronal aging with our interest in behaviorally (i.e., stress)-
   induced plasticity. while the dendrites of prefrontal neurons in young
   animals recover from stress-induced retraction, this capacity for
   recovery is absent in middle-aged and aged animals. furthermore,
   prefrontal neurons in middle-aged and aged rats lose spines with aging
   in the absence of stress and are further stress-induced synaptic loss
   or plasticity.  we are now pursuing the mechanisms responsible for
   age-related loss of experience dependent plasticity.

   dr. zhang's multiscale network modeling laboratory (mnml) is focused on
   construction and characterization of multiscale biological networks
   from large-scale genomic, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic and clinical
   data. the fundamental goal of mnml's research is to not only identify
   novel pathways and driver genes for complex human diseases but also
   build up biologically plausible mechanistic models of diseases for
   subsequent experimental and clinical validations. mnml has developed
   and significantly contributed a series of influential gene network
   inference algorithms that have been extensively used for identification
   of novel pathways and gene targets, as well as development of drugs for
   complex human diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, alzheimer's,
   obesity and diabetes. mnml's latest research that uncovered dramatic
   changes in gene-gene interaction patterns in alzheimer's disease and
   pinpointed an immune/microglia gene network as the top pathway causally
   linked to the disease was just published in cell. dr. zhang's recent
   research that sheds a new light on targeted therapies against breast
   cancer was featured in a press release by the aacr basic cancer
   research conference in 2011. dr. zhang's work on predicting genetic
   interactions was identified by nature biotechnology as one of the
   breakthroughs in the field of computational biology in 2010. the
   discovery of a gene cluster that is causally linked to obesity and
   diabetes was highlighted in nature in 2008.

   the goal of our research is to better understand the molecular
   mechanisms of addiction and depression. we use animal models of these
   disorders to identify the ways in which long-term exposure to drugs of
   abuse or stress changes the brain to lead to addiction- or
   depression-like syndromes. a major focus of our work is on drug- and
   stress-induced changes in gene expression and chromatin structure
   within the brain's reward circuitry.
    we use human pluripotent stem cells to understand the mechanisms of
   malignant and non-malignant genetic blood diseases and to develop new
   therapies. we are harnessing somatic cell reprogramming and genetic
   engineering technologies to develop new models of normal and abnormal
   hematopoiesis. by capturing and introducing disease-associated genetic
   mutations and large chromosomal deletions in patient-derived induced
   pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) we study their phenotypic and functional
   consequences, attempt to reconstruct the genetic history of leukemia
   progression and seek to identify new therapeutic targets through
   genetic and chemical screens.

   even though individually rare, developmental disorders are common as a
   group: about 1 in 6 children in the u.s. were reported as having a
   developmental disability in the screening period of 2006-2008 (please
   visit the website of the centers for disease control and prevention).
   the neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds) we study include autism
   spectrum disorders (asd), intellectual disability (id) and epilepsy.
   we are dedicated to understanding the relationship between a personâs
   genes and neurodevelopmental disorders in order to help patients and
   families.
   understanding the causes of these disorders may in the future improve
   the ability to diagnose and treat children with neurodevelopmental
   disorders.
   autism spectrum disorders (asd) â autism spectrum disorders impact a
   childâs development in a number of ways: limited or unusual language
   and speech development limited or impaired social skills, and the
   presence of ritualistic or repetitive behaviors that often limit
   typical social development.
   intellectual disability (id) â intellectual disability is characterized
   by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in
   adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical
   skills, starting before 18 years old.
   epilepsy â 20 to 35 % of children with autism have seizures or develop
   epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. in turn, individuals with
   new-onset epilepsy can experience developmental and cognitive delays.
   these conditions frequently overlap with one another, in addition to
   other ndds and sometimes physical anomalies. there is very strong
   evidence that the same genetic variants can contribute to all three
   conditions, asd, id, and epilepsy. patients with different clinical
   presentations within the ndds spectrum can have mutations in the same
   gene, or in the same region that controls gene function. although
   several genes have been identified for autism, and to a lesser extent
   for epilepsy, the etiology remains unknown in most affected
   individuals.
   we are interested in understanding how genetic changes can lead to the
   emergence and co-ocurrence of various ndds. with a better understanding
   of the biological basis of ndds, scientists and doctors can hope to
   bring families and patients more personalized care and effective
   treatment in the future.
   neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds), such as developmental delay,
   autism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability are frequent in children
   and can have a genetic basis.
   we are interested in learning how genetic changes can affect brain
   development, and, subsequently, lead to disease. this study will
   examine similarities and differences in the genes of people with ndds
   and their family members.
   ndds can co-occur in the same family or the same person, suggesting
   that they may be caused by similar or related genetic changes. by
   mapping both shared and distinct changes we will better understand the
   biological basis of each disorder.
   subjects and their family members will donate a blood sample, in the
   same way blood is drawn at a doctorâs office. all samples will be given
   an anonymous code number, and used only for research purposes. no names
   or personal information will be linked to the samples.
   in a large percentage of ndds patients, the genetic changes have not
   yet been identified. this study will use your samples for research
   purposes only, meaning that what we learn from the analysis of an
   individual's sample has no direct benefit for the individual. however,
   by gathering information from many individuals, we hope to learn more
   about how changes affecting genes can lead to ndds.
   the participation of many individuals with ndds and their family
   members is the necessary foundation for making these discoveries.
   children and young adults with a diagnosis of intellectual disability
   and/or autism spectrum disorders and/or epilepsy with unknown cause.
   parents and family members of those with ndds are eligible to
   participate whether or not they have ndds. research is usually more
   informative when both parents are enrolled in their childâs study.
   if you agree to participate, a questionnaire will be completed, you
   will participate in an interview, and donate a blood sample.

   as chief of the image acquisition core, dr. o'halloran's work is
   focused on bringing innovative new imaging techniques to bear on
   problems in basic and clinical research. his primary area of focus is
   on diffusion weighted imaging (dwi), in particular on high-resolution
   dwi. at high spatial resolution, dwi allows visualization of the white
   matter pathways that connect functional areas of the brain. one
   application of this technique that dr. o'halloran is focused on is in
   the planning of deep brain stimulation surgery to treat conditions such
   as parkinson's disease, dystonia, and depression. dr. o'halloran's
   other interests include image reconstruction and motion correction.
   patient motion continues to be a major problem in mri, causing failed
   or prolonged exams which ultimately results in increased heath care
   costs. solutions to patient motion can be implemented on both the
   acquisition and image reconstruction side, and can potentially benefit
   a wide range of mr imaging techniques.

   drug discovery target identification and validation to meet the needs
   of patients has become even more challenging in spite of the huge
   amounts of genomic and metabolomic data available today.  close
   collaboration between biological and chemical sciences is vital to
   determine biological mechanisms of disease and to discover approaches
   to positively impact the disease state through intervention using
   molecular therapeutics. the research program of our laboratory is to
   develop novel chemical and biological tools in collaboration with our
   colleagues across the wide variety of therapeutic areas of interest to
   the mount sinai research community.  targets meeting sufficient
   criteria of validation have the opportunity to enter into the drug
   discovery portfolio of the experimental therapeutics institute.
    the laboratory supports many drug discovery and development activities
   including:
   -      evaluation of high throughput and virtual screens
   -      hit validation and follow-up
   -      lead identification
   -     chemical tools for in vivo studies in preclinical animal models
   of disease
   -  lead optimization with the eventual goal of  identification of
   candidates for clinical studies.
   in addition, an important focus of the laboratory is to develop key
   chemical and biochemical tools necessary to create translational and
   target engagement biomarkers, including imaging agents, to further
   understand the impact on disease states and underlying biology to
   effectively intervene in the designated disease pathway.
   the laboratory works toward the identification of novel chemical matter
   by developing new chemical processes and syntheses in the areas of
   heterocyclic chemistry and carbon-carbon bond forming reactions to

   dna damage and repair
   the long-term goal of this project is to develop a molecular
   understanding, derived from a combined theoretical-experimental
   collaborative approach, of the principles of specific dna damage
   recognition and repair. the collaboration is between this laboratory
   and that of j. b. alexander ross.
   two mechanisms of damage repair are important for the maintenance of
   the genetic material encoded in dna. one is the excision of the damage
   followed by a restoration of the correct dna sequence in a number of
   coordinated steps represented by the base excision pathway (ber). the
   other repair process is accomplished by an error-free translesion
   synthesis. we study the mechanism of damage recognition and its
   excision by two repair enzymes: endonuclease v (endov) recognizes a
   thymine dimer (td) and flips the complementary adenine to the 5-thymine
   of the td into a protein pocket before hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond
   of the td. uracil dna glycosylase (udg) recognizes uracil in dna, flips
   it into a specific pocket and hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond. it
   appears that the mechanism of base flipping is universal to base
   excision repair. thus, this project concentrates on understanding the
   molecular, energetic and kinetic elements that differentiate base
   flipping in damaged from undamaged dna.
   specificity of enzymes is determined not only by the recognition event,
   but also by the catalytic mechanism. the enzymatic catalysis of ber
   enzymes begins with a glycosylase step. the ionization states of
   several groups in the active sites of endov or udg are important for
   catalysis. we have computed the pka values of the amino acids in the
   active site of endov and on this basis we propose a catalytic mechanism
   of the glycosylase step in the enzyme (fuxreiter, m. warshel, a. osman,
   r. the role of active site residues in the glycosylase step of t4
   endonuclease v. computer simulation studies on ionization states.
   biochemistry, 38:9577-9589,1999). we have studied by md simulations the
   reactant and product states of udg in complex with its substrate and on
   the basis of structural, electrostatic and dynamic changes we propose a
   mechanism of catalysis for the enzyme (luo, n. mehler, e. osman, r.

    in our daily lives we often encounter both pleasurable and aversive
   situations, which heighten our emotional state and affect cognition.
   the ability to flexibly regulate our emotions in response to such
   events is essential for adapting to our environment and, ultimately,
   for our mental health. many forms of mental illness involve dysfunction
   in the neural systems that regulate affective processing and decision
   making. the limbic system, which includes parts of the prefrontal
   cortex and medial temporal lobe, is critical for regulating emotions
   and plays an essential role in cognition. the main focus of the
   rudebeck lab is to understand how interaction between the prefrontal
   cortex and subcortical structures such as the amygdala contribute to
   emotional regulation and decision-making. to do this, we use a
   combination of behavioral, autonomic, neurophysiological and
   interference methods in animal models.

   overview.
   â â â  the liver accomplishes an amazing array of physiological tasks,
   including energy homeostasis, xenobiotic metabolism, serum protein
   secretion and bile production. despite the remarkable regenerative
   capacity of the liver, it is not always able to undergo efficient
   repair, and diseases of the liver are common. our lab uses zebrafish to
   understand liver development and disease.
   the role of uhrf1 in liver development.
   figure 1. the liver is well formed in 5 day embryos. a. transgenic fish
   expressing gfp in hepatocytes. b. in situ hybridization with the fabp10
   hepatocyte-specific probe.
   figure 2. the liver is small in 4 day embryos that lack uhrf1. uhrf1
   morphants (bottom 4 larvae) expressing gfp in hepatocytes have small
   livers and developmental defects compared to controls (top)
   is uhrf1 an oncogene?
   â â â  our experiments demonstrate that uhrf1 is required for liver
   growth under physiologic conditions. our next question is to determine
   whether high levels of uhrf1 contribute to unregulated hepatocyte
   proliferation, as is found in hepatocellular carcinoma. to address this
   question, we collaborate with the mount sinai liver cancer research
   program directed by dr. josep llovet. we have found that uhrf1 is
   highly expressed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,
   and studies are underway to establish the significance of this finding.
   how does uhrf1 function to regulate hepatocyte proliferation?
   â â â  recent, exciting data indicates that a primary role of uhrf1 in
   mammals is to direct dna methyl transferase (dnmt1) to hemi-methylated
   dna during replication. uhrf1 is required for maintaining dna
   methylation and loss of uhrf1 causes significant changes in
   methylation. our working model is that zebrafish with depleted uhrf1
   fail to undergo methylation-mediated silencing of genes which halt the
   cell cycle (i.e. tumor suppressors). currently, work in the lab is
   focused on identifying potential important uhrf1 target genes.
   how is uhrf1 regulated?
   figure 3. uhrf1 is localized to the nucleus in mammalian cells.
   the genetics of fatty liver disease
   fatty liver disease is most frequently associated with obesity or
   alcohol abuse, and a range from fat accumulating in hepatocytes
   (steatosis) to the severe steatohepatitis fall under the umbrella of
   this disease. we are using zebrafish genetics to understand the factors
   that contribute to steatosis.
   alcoholic liver disease
   figure 4. acute exposure to ethanol causes steatosis in 4 day zebrafish
   larvae.
   metabolic liver disease
   figure 5. fgr mutants have hepatomegaly (top) and defective hepatocytes
   which do not store glycogen (bottom).
   the fgr gene is highly conserved in animals, and the fgr protein does
   not have any known function. efforts are underway to determine the
   cellular function of fgr and to elucidate the mechanism by which
   mutation of this novel gene gives rise to steatosis.â
   â â â  we find that fgr mutants have defects in protein secretion,
   activation of the unfolded protein response and hepatic endoplasmic
   reticulum (er) stress. current work is focused on determining how
   disruption of the secretory pathway and er stress causes steatosis.

   our lab is interested in understanding how neurotrophic growth factors,
   including nerve growth factor (ngf) and brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor (bdnf), regulate nervous system development and function. we
   study neurotrophin action through the identification of gene products
   that these growth factors regulate in the cns and pns, determining how
   these proteins are involved in neurogenesis, axonal outgrowth and
   pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, using cellular
   and molecular tools, and knockout mouse models. together with the
   benson lab, we're currently examining how the ngf-regulated cell
   surface adhesion protein, called nilegp or l1, an immunoglobulin (ig)
   superfamily member that is expressed primarily in the nervous system,
   regulates axonal outgrowth, branching, pathfinding, and fasciculation,
   as well as neuronal migration. of note, inherited x-linked mutations in
   l1 result in hydrocephalus and mental retardation (crash and masa
   syndromes). in addition, we're trying to understand how the
   neurotrophin-inducible gene vgf, encoding a secreted `granin-like'
   protein and peptide precursor, controls energy expenditure, memory, and
   depressive behavior. recent collaborative studies with the huntley,
   alberini, shapiro, and duman laboratories indicate that vgf-derived
   peptides injected into the brain have anti-depressant efficacy,
   consistent with abnormalities noted in memory tasks and depressed
   behavior in vgf knockout mice, and that vgf regulates hippocampal
   synaptic activity via a bdnf-dependent mechanism. we are developing
   novel conditional and humanized knockout models to better understand
   vgf function in the developing and adult hippocampus, hypothalamus, and
   sympathetic nervous system.

   can we change our emotions? our lab is interested in discovering the
   neural mechanisms underlying emotional control and flexibility. because
   the environment we live in is constantly changing, we need to
   continuously update our emotional responses. in extreme situations,
   when emotional memories become traumatic, we might even wish to 'erase'
   emotional memories altogether. our research team uses neuroimaging,
   pharmacology and psychophysiology to understand the neural mechanisms
   that make such emotional flexibility. we examine emotional processing
   in the normal brain and in patients with anxiety disorders, and hope to
   promote new forms of treatment.
   our lab studies the neural mechanisms of memory in the everyday sense
   of the word: the ability to learn new facts and remember recent events.
   although for many years scientists believed that only one form of
   learning existed in the brain, we now know that different brain
   networks are crucial for different types of learning. for example, the
   hippocampus is needed to learn and remember new facts and recent
   events, the amygdala is crucial for earning emotional associations, and
   the neostriatum is required for certain forms of skill learning. my
   research focuses on how the hippocampus, refrontal cortex, and other
   brain areas contribute to memory in experimental animals, mostly rats,
   and how mechanisms of neuronal plasticity within these structures
   contribute to memory functions. experiments in my lab are guided by
   cognitive, computational, physiological, and pharmacological
   hypotheses.
   the basic idea is that the properties of the nmda receptor allows cells
   in the hippocampus to conjoin temporally overlapping cortical inputs
   into representations of events, and that recurrent connections within
   the hippocampus and between it and other structures allow these events
   to be linked into the sequences that comprise episodic memories.
   interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex allow
   specific memories to guide response rules, and different strategies and
   motives allow the prefrontal cortex to select among memories in
   otherwise identical situations. experiments investigating the links
   between these different levels of analysis are aimed toward providing
   an integrated perspective of memory.
   to study the molecular mechanisms of drug addiction and depression, a
   lot of high throughput experimental data have been generated. our lab
   focuses on the statistical and integrated analysis of these data and
   generates biological insights. we are especially interested in the
   next-generation sequencing data which provides a comprehensive and
   high-resolution view of the biological systems under study. we also
   develop bioinformatic tools employing bayesian inference and machine
   learning to aid our data analysis.

   our main research focus is on elucidation of the pathophysiology of
   primary dystonia through the investigations of its neuroimaging,
   neuropathological, clinical, genetic and environmental correlates. we
   are also interested in comparisons of imaging features of dystonia with
   other movement disorders, such as essential tremor and parkinson's
   disease.
   our recent research direction includes studies on functional and
   structural connectome of high frequency networks in epilepsy.
   using multi-disciplinary approach and novel technologies, we are
   developing a better understanding of normal and diseased states of the
   central nervous system, which will ultimately help develop new
   therapeutic options for patients with movement disorders and epilepsy.

   basic functions in the brain, such as making decisions, consuming food
   and forming memories, rely on a proper balance of excitatory and
   inhibitory neuronal signals. our research focuses on the function of
   potassium ion channels, which generate one of the inhibitory signals in
   the brain. we are particularly interested in g protein-regulated
   potassium channels and their role in drug addiction and mental
   disorders. we have unraveled the molecular details underlying g protein
   modulation, elucidated a structural mechanism of alcohol-mediated
   activation, and discovered drug-induced plasticity for these g
   protein-gated potassium channels. as potassium channels emerge as
   critical gatekeepers of neuronal excitability, the results of our
   research may lead to the development of more effective treatments for
   diverse neurological diseases such as epilepsy, down syndrome, alcohol
   abuse and drug addiction.

   dr. aaronson is an internationally recognized cancer biologist, who in
   early studies established the transformation-competent but replication
   defective nature of mammalian sarcoma viruses and molecularly cloned
   many of their oncogenes. he and colleagues implicated
   retroviral-related oncogenes in human cancer through investigations
   including the initial detection of their expression in human tumors and
   critical contributions to the demonstration of their involvement in
   human cancer. his investigations of the v-sis oncogene established the
   first normal function of an oncogene and the role of oncogenes in
   growth factor signaling. his discovery of erbb2 as a v-erbb-related
   gene amplified in a human breast carcinoma and demonstration of its
   transforming properties paved the way for targeted therapies directed
   against its product.
   he isolated kgf (fgf7), a growth factor with novel epithelial cell
   specificity and demonstrated its involvement in wound repair. its
   successful phase iii clinical trial by amgen for treatment of
   mucositis, recently led the fda to approve kepivance (kgf) for
   treatment of this debilitating side effect of many cancer therapies.
   thus, dr. aaronson's pioneering discoveries have directly led to new
   therapies for cancer patients.
   his development and application of stable expression cdna cloning
   technology resulted in his identification of new human oncogenes,
   growth factor receptors, and other genes, which induce transformation
   or drug resistance. he and colleagues identified the protooncogene
   product, met, as the receptor for hgf/scatter factor and lrp5/6 as the
   receptor for a novel wnt antagonist, dkk1. this latter discovery paved
   the way for his recent demonstration with colleagues of a wnt autocrine
   transforming mechanism in human malignancies.
   dr. aaronson received his m.d. from ucsf in 1966. he joined the
   national institutes of health in 1967 and became chief of the
   laboratory of cellular and molecular biology at the national cancer
   institute in 1977. he joined mount sinai in 1994 and is the jack and
   jane b. aron professor and founding chair, emeritus of the department
   of oncological sciences. he is the recipient of numerous awards
   including the distinguished service medal from the u.s. public health
   service, the rhoads memorial award from the american association of
   cancer research, and the paul erhlich prize from germany. he is the
   author of over 530 publications, an inventor on more than 50 patents,
   and serves on numerous editorial boards and scientific advisory
   committees.

   research
   we use a multidisciplinary approach that combines behavioral,
   morphological, electrophysiological, cell biological and
   molecular-biological techniques to explain the neural basis of those
   forms of behavioral plasticity that are due to changes in the internal
   state of the organism. our primary interest is in mechanisms that
   establish internal states and in memory mechanisms that are responsible
   for persistence of these states.
   we have chosen to study internal states in a preparation that has a
   relatively simple nervous system - the marine mollusc aplysia
   californica. the central nervous system of this animal is distributed
   into several ganglia, each of which consists of a limited number of
   neurons, many of which are large and easily identifiable as unique
   individuals.
   the ability to recognize the same neurons from animal to animal has
   greatly facilitated the functional characterization of individual cells
   as sensory neurons, motor neurons and interneurons. this in turn has
   allowed the reconstruction of neuronal circuits that mediate a variety
   of behaviors. circuit-level analysis has provided new insights into the
   organization of neuronal networks into mediating and modulatory systems
   and led to a new conceptualization of command neurons.
   studies of transmitters and modulators involved in the regulation of
   behavior have resulted in purification and sequencing of several novel
   neuropeptides and to molecular cloning of the mrna of these molecules.
   these neuropeptides have now been localized to specific neurons, and
   shown to act as cotransmitters. to a large extent our research is now
   focused on the role that these peptidergic cotransmitters play in
   optimizing the efficiency of behavior in response to changes in the
   motivational state of the animal. we are particularly interested in
   determining:
   we expect that this approach will yield a unified picture in which our
   understanding of behavioral plasticity will extend all the way from
   behavior to the molecules involved.

   our research focuses on the cellular mechanisms underlying cns
   disorders and their treatment. we use advanced genetic mouse models,
   viral mediated gene transfer and optogenetics to understand the network
   and cell type specific mechanisms underlying chronic pain, addiction,
   and depression.   a large part of our work, concerns the study of rgs
   proteins (regulators of g protein signaling) in the brain.  rgs
   proteins modulate a number of important functions in the cns by
   regulating the activity of heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunits but
   also by various other interactions which affect receptor
   desentitization, ion channel function or transcriptional activity.  our
   earlier work revealed a potent role of rgs9-2 in the striatum in drug
   addiction and identified rgs9-2 complexes associated with agonist
   biased signaling. more recently, we explored the role of rgs4 in
   antidepressant drug actions and its role in various forms of chronic
   pain.
   we focus on five major research areas:
   signal transduction complexes in the striatum in drug addiction
   regulation of g protein signaling in stress and depression
   novel intracellular targets for chronic pain treatment
   epigenetic adaptations in chronic pain models
   regulators of g protein signaling and obesity

   ubiquitin signaling in cancer biology
    post-doctoral fellows: kenneth wu and xinson xu
   graduate student: jordan kovacev
   covalent linkage of ubiquitin chains to cellular proteins leads to
   targeted degradation by the 26s proteasome, thus promoting
   unidirectional alteration of a divergent array of cellular processes
   that include cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and tumor
   suppression.
   central to the ubiquitination reaction are the recognition of a
   substrate by an e3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which also functions to
   recruit an e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that catalyzes the transfer
   of ubiquitin to the target protein. work from this laboratory has
   helped uncovering a super-family of cullin-roc1 ring based e3 ligases.
   we are focusing on scf, the prototype of cullin-ring e3, with specific
   interest to understand the mechanisms by which it targets protein
   substrates for polyubiquitination and eventual proteasomal
   degradation.  given its broad spectrum of protein targets, the scf
   pathway profoundly impacts a wide range of biological processes,
   including cell growth and death, development, signal transduction,
   transcriptional control, genomic integrity, and tumor suppression.
   we have discovered an scf-like e3 ligase complex containing cul7, fbw8,
   skp1 and roc1. dysregulation of the cul7 e3 ligase has been directly
   linked to hereditary human diseases as cul7 germline mutations were
   found in patients with autosomal-recessive 3-m and yakuts short stature
   syndromes, which are characterized by profound pre- and postnatal
   growth retardation. recently, we have identified insulin receptor
   substrate 1, a critical mediator of insulin and insulin-like growth
   factor-1 signaling, as the proteolytic target of the cul7 e3 ligase,
   suggesting a role for cul7 as a novel growth regulator. we are
   currently exploring pathomechanistic insights into cul7-linked growth
   retardation syndromes.

   the lab is interested in molecular mechanisms of how neurons are born,
   how they extend axons, and how they regenerate or fail to regenerate
   after mammalian cns injury. we use in vivo axon injury models, neuronal
   cultures, molecular biology, and various imaging and tissue engineering
   techniques to study classic and identify novel signaling pathways and
   epigenetic mechanisms that promote neurogenesis and axonogenesis. such
   knowledge is crucial for targeting molecules for effective cns
   regeneration. similar mechanisms also have relevance in cns tumor
   biology. discovering the molecular driving forces of tumor stem cell
   migration, proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal will point
   to novel therapeutic approaches.
